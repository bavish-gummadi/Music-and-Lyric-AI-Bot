# Music and Lyric AI Bot

**Music and Lyric AI Bot** is about using artificial intelligence to automatically generate lyrics and music using datasets from various artists

This project utilizes multiple python packages as well as Twiiter's Tweepy API. This project contains
an interactive twitterbot, grammar checker and rhyme generator for our lyrics. 
Using this the Tweepy API, we were able to update the twitter 
status of a twitter account we created specifcally for this project. Additionally, we
were able to scan current tweets using this API. Using previous abilities to generate 
random lyrical sentences based on an author, we constructed an interface where we 
create random lyrics and we ask the user for an indicator of who to send these lyrics
to. So, a mindful user would have some randomly generated Bob Dylan lyrics sent to
someone who recently posted about Bob Dylan. The tweets show up immediately under the
BATT Productions twitter account. By scraping for more lyrics by more musicians, 
we enhanced our previous design from the core to incorporate multiple authors. Now,
users can select which authors lyrics they would like and who they would like to send
them to. 

Download nltk. Download the tagger. For the grammatical lyrics aspect of this project, the lyrics generated by generateLyricalSentence are checked in the process of generating the lyrics to ensure they are grammatically accurate. There is a tag function that uses an nltk tagger to tag the words as the lyrics are being generated. There are two functions, after() and during() in which there are grammar rules for English that are used by generateLyricalSentence in order to ensure that the grammar is accurate. These functions use the tagged version of the words.
