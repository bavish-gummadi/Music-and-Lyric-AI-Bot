Here are a few notes to get you started:

* Don't touch the __init__.py files. These are necessary to your project.

* Things will be easier if you read the spec first and follow the given function order.

* Make sure you have ```pip``` installed so you download pysynth.

* Remember to update this file to describe your finished Final Project.

Have fun on the project!
  
  For the Reach portion of BATT Production's project, we created a interactive twitterbot
and constructed a grammar checker for our lyrics. With regards to the twitterbot, we
utilized Twitter's tweepy API. Using this API, we were able to update the twitter 
status of a twitter account we created specifcally for this project. Additionally, we
were able to scan current tweets using this API. Using previous abilities to generate 
random lyrical sentences based on an author, we constructed an interface where we 
create random lyrics and we ask the user for an indicator of who to send these lyrics
to. So, a mindful user would have some randomly generated Bob Dylan lyrics sent to
someone who recently posted about Bob Dylan. The tweets show up immediately under the
BATT Productions twitter account. By scraping for more lyrics by more musicians, 
we enhanced our previous design from the core to incorporate multiple authors. Now,
users can select which authors lyrics they would like and who they would like to send
them to. 

Download nltk. Download the tagger. For the grammatical lyrics aspect of this project, the lyrics generated by generateLyricalSentence are checked in the process of generating the lyrics to ensure they are grammatically accurate. There is a tag function that uses an nltk tagger to tag the words as the lyrics are being generated. There are two functions, after() and during() in which there are grammar rules for English that are used by generateLyricalSentence in order to ensure that the grammar is accurate. These functions use the tagged version of the words.
