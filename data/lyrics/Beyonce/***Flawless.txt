Beyonc
I'm out that H-Town, comin' comin' down;
I'm comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground...
H-H-Tow-Town, I'm comin' down;
Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground...

I know when you were little girls, you dreamt of being in my world...
Don't forget it, don't forget it;
Respect that - bow down, bitches... (Crown!)

I took some time to live my life, but don't think I'm just his little wife...
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted;
This my shit - bow down, bitches...

Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches... (Crown!)
Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches... (Crown!)
H-Town vicious, H, H-Town vicious;
I'm so crown, crown - bow down, bitches!

I'm out that H-Town, comin' comin' down;
I'm comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground...
H-H-Tow-Town, I'm comin' down;
Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground...

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller.
We say to girls, "You can have ambition, but not too much.
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful, otherwise you will threaten the man."
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage.
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important.
Now marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support,
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage, and we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls see to each other as competitors,
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing, 
But for the attention of men.
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are.
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes.
