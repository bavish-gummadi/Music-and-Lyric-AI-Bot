If I ain't got nothin', I got you
If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn, 'cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra, but I know 1 + 1 = 2,
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through,
'Cause baby, we ain't got nothin' without love
Darling, you got enough for the both of us,
So come on, baby, make love to me

When my days look low, pull me in close and don't let me go - Make love to me
So when the world's at war, let our love heal us all - 
Right now, baby, make love to me
Me, me, me, me
Oh, oh, make love to me

Hey, I don't know much about guns, but I, I've been shot by you!
Hey, and I don't know when I'm gon' die, but I hope that I'm gon' die by you!
Hey, and I don't know much about fighting, but I, I know I will fight for you!
Hey, and just when I ball up my fist, I realize that I'm laying right next to you!
Baby, we ain't got nothing but love
And darling, you got enough for the both of us
Whoo, make love to me

When my days look low, pull me in close and don't let me go, make love to me
So when the world's at war, let our love heal us all;
Help me let down my guard - make love to me
Me, me, me, me
Oh, oh, make love to me
Me, me, me, me''''''''''''''''''''''''''
