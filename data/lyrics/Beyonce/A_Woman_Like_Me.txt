Do you think you could fall for a woman like me?
'Cause I find it hard to trust, I need too much,
And I really don't believe in love, no, no...

Do you think that I could be the girl of your dreams?
Sometimes I don't let things go, get emotional,
And sometimes, I'm just out of control...

You need to stop for a minute,
Before you get too deep up in it... (Too deep...)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems;
It's hard lovin' a woman, a woman like me... (Woman like me...)
You need to think about it,
Before you get hooked on the venom, and can't live without it... (No, no, no!)
Can't believe everything you see;
It's hard lovin' a woman, a woman like me...

Do you think that I could be the one that you seek?
'Cause baby, I'm one step ahead, you're two steps behind,
But, baby, I don't mind...

Do you think that I could make you real happy, baby?
Just don't get me wrong - my lovin' is so strong,
But I ain't tryin' to lead you on, no, no...

You need to stop for a minute,
Before you get too deep up in it... (No, no...)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems; (Seems...)
It's hard lovin' a woman, a woman like me... (Woman like me...)
You need to think about it,
Before you get hooked on the venom, and can't live without it... (Live without it, yeah...)
Can't believe everything you see;
It's hard lovin' a woman, a woman like me...
Woman like me...
A woman like me...
Woman like me, oh!

You need to stop for a minute, (Stop for one minute,)
Before you get too deep up in it... ('Fore you get too deep up in it!)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems;
It's hard lovin' a woman, a woman like me...
You need to think about it, (Think about it, baby!)
Before you get hooked on the venom, and can't live without it (No, no...)
Can't believe everything you see;
It's hard lovin' a woman...
Woman like me...
Woman like me...
Woman like me...''''''''''''''''
