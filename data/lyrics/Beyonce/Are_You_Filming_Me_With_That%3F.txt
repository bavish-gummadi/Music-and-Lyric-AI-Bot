I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keeps the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a leash though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me

Come harder; this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself; trust me, you need me
This ain't no shoulder with a chip or an ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

You need a real woman in your life (that's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (that's a good look)
And I'm-a help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet a hood look; ladies that's a good look)
Believe me, when you're in them big meetings for the mils (that's a good look)
You take me just to complement the deal (that's a good look)
And anything you cop, I split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet a hood look; ladies, that's a good look)
Believe me

I can do for you what Martin did for the people
Ran by the man, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equal
Still play my part and let you take the lead role
Believe me

I'll follow; this could be easy
I'll be the help whenever you need me
I see your hustle; with my hustle I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

You need a real woman in your life (that's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (that's a good look)
I can help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet a hood look; ladies that's a good look)
Believe me, when you're in them big meetings for the mils (that's a good look)
You take me just to complement the deal (that's a good look)
Anything you cop, I split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet a hood look; ladies, that's a good look)
Believe me

I be the b-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, Bubbles, Loraine Schwartz sorta dude
It's big ballin', baby, when I'm courtin' you
I'm talking spa bags and fly pads and rooms at the Bloomberg
And rumors you on the verge of a new marriage
'Cause that rock on your finger's like a tumor
You can't fit your hand in your new purse
It's humorous to me; they watchin' and we just yachtin'
Island hoppin' off the Omafi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn
No, not the car, but everywhere we are?
You sure to see stars
This is high-level, not eye-level

I'll order yours tomorrow; now look at the time I saved ya
Mama, let me upgrade ya

Just when you think you had it all
Big ends, car notes, collectin' cars
Picture your life elevated with me
Make you my project celebrity
I'll keep your name hot in them streets

It's that little glimpse of light
That makes the diamond really shine
And you already is a star
But unless you're flawless
Then your dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

Dimples in your neck tie
Hermez briefcase
Cartier top clips
Silk line blazers
Diamond cream facials
VVS cuff links
Six star pimp suites
Partner, let me upgrade ya, grade ya
Partner, partner, let me upgrade ya, grade ya
Let me, let me, let me upgrade ya, grade ya
Partner, partner, partner, let me upgrade ya''''''''''''''''''
