I love your face
You love the taste
That sugar babe, it melts away

I kiss you when you lick your lips, I kiss you when you lick your lips
You like it wet and so do I, You like it wet and so do I
I know you never waste a trip, I know you never waste a trip
I wonder how it feels sometimes
Must be good to you

Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing


Can you lick my skittles
That's the sweetest in the middle
Pink that's the flavor
Solve the riddle
I'll lean back on my wrist something major
Make sure you clean max
That's the only way to get the
Flavor

When you're thirsty and need love
I give it up 'til I'm empty babe
Must be good to you
If you're lonely in your bed, fill it up to the top
Must be good to you

Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing

Can you lick my skittles
That's the sweetest in the middle
Pink that's the flavor
Solve the riddle
I'll lean back on my wrist something major
Make sure you clean max
That's the only way to get the
Flavor
