Sometimes, these walls seem to cave in on me,
But when I look in your eyes, I feel alive...
Some days, we say words that don't mean a thing,
But when you're holding me tight, I feel alive...

Make it last forever;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me...
You and I, together;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, ooh...

Each day, I feel so blessed to be looking at you,
'Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive...
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name,
When I'm holding you tight, I'm so alive,
So now, let's just live it up...

Make it last forever;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me...
You and I, together;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, ooh...

Baby, last forever;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me...
You and I, together;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, Blue...

We gotta hold on...
I gotta hold on...
You've got to hold on...
You've got a hold on, a hold onto me...

We gotta hold on...
I've gotta hold on...
You've got to hold on...
You've got a hold on, a hold onto me...

Make it last forever;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me...
You and I, together;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, Blue...

Blue Ivy:
Hold on to me, hold on...
Bee-sy-ay, Bee-sy-ay...
(Blue...) Bee-sy-ay...
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!
Mrs. Carter...
Mrs. Carter...
Mrs. Carter...''''''''''''''''''''
