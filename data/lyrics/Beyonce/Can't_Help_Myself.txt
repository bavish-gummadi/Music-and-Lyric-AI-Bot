Can't Help Myself

-T-Boz-

Never lost that feeling
Once I got that feeling for you
I knew ... that there was something special
You had a certain sparkle 'bout you
It's true

I could not be more sinceare
Boy whenever you are near
I just lose my mind, I get weak inside
Swear I can do anything
And i

I can't help myself
I'm in love with you and nobody else
It's real as hell
And I can't deny it's how I feel

Beyonc
Never did stop falling
Once you started calling for me
Fell deep
Living in deniel
Couldn't see what you saw in me
Ooh baby baby now i

I can see it all so clear
I have nothing left to fear
With you by my side
Ain't no need to hide
I can tell you anything

I can't help myself (ooh)
I'm in love with you and nobody else
It's real as hell
And I can't deny it's how I feel

Feel, feel, feel
I...
I can't help myself ... (can't help)
I can't help myself ... (myself)
Ooh baby baby baby

I can see it all so clear (All so clear)
I have nothing left to fear (Fear)
With you by my side (Ooh)
Ain't no need to hide
I can tell you anything

I can't help myself
I'm in love with you and nobody else
It's real as hell
And I can't deny it's how I feel

I can't help..(can't help)
Help myself..(myself)
I can't help ...
I'm in love with you and nobody else

I can't help..(ooh)
Help myself...
I can't help ...
I'm in love with you and nobody else

I can't help..(ooh)
Help myself...
I can't help ...
I'm in love with you and nobody else

I can't help...
Help myself...
I can't help ...
And I can't deny it's how I feel'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
