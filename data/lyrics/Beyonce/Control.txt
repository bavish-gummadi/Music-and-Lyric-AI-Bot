I gotta give up to quiet the storm that rages inside...
The way that I hit my damaged pride; 
You gave me away...

And I've had enough - I imagine the words I say to you...
I'm finding the strength to follow it through; 
I'm ready to change...

I'm letting go, I'm letting go!
We're only friends, we're only friends;
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls...

So let it show, so let it show...
We can't pretend, we can't pretend;
We only find ourselves by losing all
Control... 
Control...
Control...
Control...
Control... (Control...)
Control... (Control...)
Control... (Control...)
Control...

I'm opening up - Show me a sign I can't relieve...
These crazy emotions flow through me;
I'm gonna explode, oh!

You take me away from what is my ordinary life;
I won't be afraid of what we might find:
A love I can hold...

I'm letting go, I'm letting go!
We're only friends, we're only friends;
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls...

So let it show, so let it show...
We can't pretend, we can't pretend;
We only find ourselves by losing all
Control... 

Nothing ventured, nothing gained...
A new horizon ready to paint;
With every breath, you take it away...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

I'm letting go, I'm letting go!
We're only friends, we're only friends;
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls...

So let it show, so let it show...
We can't pretend, we can't pretend;
We only find ourselves by losing all
Control... 
Control...
Control...
Control...
Control... (Control...)
Control... (Control...)
Control... (Control...)
Control...

Control...
Control...
Control...''''''''''''''''''
