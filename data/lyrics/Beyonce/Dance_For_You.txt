I just wanna...
Show you how much I appreciate you
Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true

Wanna show you how much you got your girl feelin' good
Wanna show you how much, how much you're understood
Wanna show you how much, I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me bay

Wanna show you how much, I really care about yo' heart
I wanna show ya how much, I hate being apart
Show ya, show ya, show ya till you're through with me
I wanna keep it how it is, so you can never say how it used to be

Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (oh ooh oh oh)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (oh ooh oh oh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah

Tonight it's going down
I'll be rockin' on my babe rockin' rockin' on my babe
Swirlin' on you babe swirlin' swirlin' on you babe
Baby lemme put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody 'cause
It's 'bout to go down

You'll never need two, 'cause I will be your number one
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you

'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backin' this thing back
Pop-poppin' this thing back
Drop-drop-drop-dropping this thing back

This is for the time, you gave me flowers
For the world, that is ours
For the mulah, for the power of love
I know I won't never ever eh-ever give you up

And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and the freak in the you know what
Sit back sit back it's the pre game show
Daddy you know what's up

Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (oh ooh oh oh)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (oh ooh oh oh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah

Tonight it's going down
I'll be rockin' on my babe rockin' rockin' on my babe
Swirlin' on you babe swirlin' swirlin' on you babe
Baby lemme put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody 'cause
It's 'bout to go down

Imma take this time
To show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you all I need
No money can emphasize or describe
The love that's in between the lines
Boy look into my eyes

While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel

Rockin' on you babe
Rockin' rockin' on you babe
Swirlin' on you babe
In my mind all I can think about
Is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past
And a chance to make this love last

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (oh ooh oh oh)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (oh ooh oh oh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah

Tonight it's going down
I'll be rockin' on my babe rockin' rockin' on my babe
Swirlin' on you babe swirlin' swirlin' on you babe
Baby lemme put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody 'cause
It's 'bout to go down''''''''''''''''''
