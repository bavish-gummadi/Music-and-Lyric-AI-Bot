Stop the track, let me state facts
I told you give me a minute, and I'll be right back
Fifty million 'round the world and they said that I couldn't get it
I done got so sick and filthy with Benjis I can't spend
How you gon' be talkin' shit?
You act like I just got up in it
Been the number one diva in this game for a minute
I know you read the paper, the one that they call a queen
Every radio 'round the world know me
'Cause that's where I be

When he pull up, wanna pop my hood up
Bet he better have a six pack, in the cooler
Getting money, divas getting money
If you ain't getting money then you ain't got nothing for me

She ain't no diva (she ain't no diva)

Since fifteen in my stilettos been struttin' in this game
What's yo age was the question they asked when I hit the stage
I'm a diva, best believe her
You see her, she getting paid
She ain't callin him to greet her
Don't need him, her bed's made
