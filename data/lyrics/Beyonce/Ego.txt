Ooh baby how you doing?
You know I'mma cut right to the chase
Some women, were made
But me, myself
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
You know, what's more special than you, you feel me?

It's on, baby let's get lost
You don't need to call into work, 'cause you the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal

Why, well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets
You didn't know was inside,
No need for me to lie

It's too big
It's too wide
It's too strong
It won't fit
It's too much
It's too tough
He talk like this
'Cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this
'Cause he can back it up

Usually I'm humble
Right now I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find
On what I'm working with
Damn I know, I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile
Or maybe my eyes
Boy you a sight to see
Kind of something like me

It's too big
It's too wide
It's too strong
It won't fit
It's too much
It's too tough
I talk like this
'Cause I can back it up
I got a big ego
Such a huge ego
But he love my big ego
It's too much
I walk like this
'Cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this
'Cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this
'Cause I can back it up
I, I can back it up
I can back it up
I walk like this
'Cause I can back it up

It's too big
It's too wide
It's too strong
It won't fit
It's too much
It's too tough
He talks like this
'Cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walks like this
'Cause he can back it up

Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano''''''''''''''''''
