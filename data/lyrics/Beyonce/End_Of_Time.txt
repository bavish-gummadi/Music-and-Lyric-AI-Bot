Come take my hand - I won't let you go
I'll be your friend - I will love you so deeply!
I will be the one to kiss you at night
I will love you until the end of time

I'll be your baby - promise not to let you go
Love you like crazy - Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go, say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go, say you'll never let me go

Take you away from here
It's nothing between us but space and time
I'll be your own little star, let me shine in your world
Be your own little universe - make me your girl!

Say you'll never let me go, say you'll never let me go

Baby, come on, get up on it, show me that you really want it
I wanna be the one to love you, baby, let's go!
(Oh, oh) Let's go! (Oh, oh)
I wanna provide this lovin' that you're givin'
I ain't frontin' in this - love oh, can you let me love you from your head to toe?
(Oh, oh) Baby, let's go! (Oh, oh)

Boy, come to me (Come to me!) Let me turn your rain into sun (Come to me, babe!)
You don't have to worry, baby (Oh, no!), I promise I'll set your heart free
Let my love into your soul - You go, I go, we go, that's all she wrote
