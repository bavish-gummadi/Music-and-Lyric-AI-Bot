Every step I make
And every breath I take
I took 'cause I can't wait
To be closer to you

Baby you're so sweet
You give me cavities
I get a stomach ache
If I can't be with you

At night I fall asleep
And I don't wanna wake up

'Cause you are in my dreams
A heavenly creation

In the body that
I only wanna share with you

Hey

Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you

Baby we will never finish
To be continued
Separation can't change
The love I feel for you
I'm gonna definitely be affectionate
Snuggle up tonight let's get real intimate
Only you can satisfy my appetite
'Cause when it comes to love
You get me get so excited
I wanna taste your lips
My body melts in bliss every time

Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you

Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you

You are my
(You are my)
Universe
(Universe)
Everything I want and
Everything I need and
Everything worth waiting for
For
For better or for worse
Constant craving
Your love enslaves me
Oh

Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you

Give it to me baby
I wanna give it to you
Give it to me baby
I can't wait
Everything I do is just for you
Everything I do is just for you
Everything I do is just for you
