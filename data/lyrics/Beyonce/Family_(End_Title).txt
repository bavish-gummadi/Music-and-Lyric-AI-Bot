It's more than you, it is more than me
No matter what we are, we are a family
This dream is for all of us, this one can be real
And you can't stop us now because of how you feel

It's more than you, it is more than me
Whatever dreams we have, they're for the family
We're not alone anymore, now there are others there
And that dream's big enough for all of us to share

So don't think that you're going
You're not going anywhere
You're staying, taking your share
And if you get afraid again, I'll be there

We are a family like a giant tree
Branching out towards the sky
We are a family, we are so much more
Than just you and I

We are a family like a giant tree
Growing stronger, growing wiser
We are growing free
We need you, we are a family''''''''''''''''
