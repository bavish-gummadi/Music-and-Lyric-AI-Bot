You're all alone and I did this - I got no one else to blame;
You didn't know I was a risk, and it's such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you and wanted nothing else from me
But to make some time for you, but all I made you was lonely...

I couldn't see, but now I know that I acted selfishly;
I should've known that I'd let you down and cause you so much misery...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...

I should've been there...
I should've been there...
I should've been there...
I should've been there...

All of the times you used to cry because I would let you down;
I'm losin' time! I should've tried a little more to be around...
But I didn't know that you were hurting, I was just too blind;
Only thing I know for certain: another you, I'll never find...

I couldn't see, but now I know that I acted selfishly;
I should've known that I'd let you down and cause you so much misery...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...

I should've been there...
I should've been there...
I should've been there...
I should've been there...

I'm filled with regret - I'm gonna tip and soak myself in misery;
Now in your life, I'll take more time - No more yearning without me...
But, it hurts to think of you all by yourself, but now I see,
And I apologize for all the times I left you home waiting for me...

I couldn't see, but now I know that I acted selfishly;
I should've known that I'd let you down and cause you so much misery...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...

I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there...

I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there...''''''''''''''''''
