To be or not to be - Not!
(Hol' up!) Bring the beat back.
(Stop!) I ain't ready yet.
(Wait!) Let me fix my hair... (Yes! Yes!)
Yes, ma'am... (Yes, ma'am...)
Now pass me my dress. (Yes!)

I think I'm ready - Been locked up in the house way too long;
It's time to get it, 'cause once again, he's out doing wrong...
And my girls are so real, said it's been a minute since I had some;
He's been acting up, but he won't be the only one...

(Oh...) 'Cause when they act wrong (Oh...), that's when you put it on;
(Oh, oh...) Get 'em uptight - this is your song...
(Oh...) Poke out your back (oh, oh...), time to impress;
(Oh...) Pull out your freakum dress!

(Oh...) Put your freakum dress on! (Oh...) Put your freakum dress on...
(Oh...) Put your freakum dress on! (Oh...) Put your freakum dress on...
(Oh...) Every woman got one... (Oh...) Shut it down when the time comes;
(Oh...) So roll out the big gun, (Oh...) and put your freakum dress on...

Soon as he saw me, turned on by how the dress was fitting right;
Short and backless (backless, backless...), seein' my silhouette in the moonlight...
Such an attraction, keep telling me how my outfit's so nice;
Little did he know - ha! - my man gon' take it off tonight...

(Oh...) 'Cause when they act wrong (Oh...), that's when you put it on;
(Oh, oh...) Get 'em uptight - this is your song...
(Oh...) Poke out your back (oh, oh...), time to impress;
(Oh...) Pull out your freakum dress!

(Oh...) Put your freakum dress on! (Oh...) Put your freakum dress on...
(Oh...) Put your freakum dress on! (Oh...) Put your freakum dress on...
(Oh...) Every woman got one... (Oh...) Shut it down when the time comes;
(Oh...) So roll out the big gun, (Oh...) and put your freakum dress on...

All the ladies, you ain't get all dressed up in your dresses,
And your best digs for no reason - Get ready to freakum, freakum!

When you put it on, it's an invitation;
When they play your song, get on up and shake it! (Yeah...)
Pokin' out your back - you don't have to waste it,
Spin it all around, then take it to the ground, and...

When you put it on, it's an invitation! (Hey!)
When they play your song, get on up and shake it! (Hey!)
Pokin' out your back - you don't have to waste it, (Hey!)
Spin it all around, then take it to the ground, and...

(Oh...) 'Cause when they act wrong (Oh...), that's when you put it on;
(Ooh, 'cause when he act wrong, hey!)
(Oh, oh...) Get 'em uptight - this is your song... [Get 'em uptight...]
(Oh...) Poke out your back (oh, oh...), time to impress; [Oh! Oh!]
(Oh...) Pull out your freakum dress! [Freakum dress...]

(Oh...) Put your freakum dress on! (Oh...) Put your freakum dress on...
(Oh...) Put your freakum dress on! (Oh...) Put your freakum dress on...
(Oh...) Every woman got one... (Oh...) Shut it down when the time comes;
(Oh...) So roll out the big gun, (Oh...) and put your freakum dress on...

Ladies, looky here: when you been with your man for a long time (oh...),
Every now and then, you got to go in the back of that closet and pull out that freakum dress. (Oh...) Huh!
I got my freakum dress on. I got my freakum dress on. (Oh...)
I got my freakum dress on. I got my freakum dress on. (Oh...)''''''''''''''''''''''
