Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new
I'm a wall, come and march on the regular
Painting white flags blue

Lord forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'mma rain, I'mma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose
Singin', "Freedom, freedom, where are you?"
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'mma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

I'mma wade, I'mma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof

Lord forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose
Singin', "Freedom, freedom, where are you?"
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'mma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose
Singin', "Freedom, freedom, where are you?"
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'mma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
Hear me out

I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to cool myself off
I was served lemons, but I made lemonade''''''''''''''''
