A gift (a gift) from Virgo... (Virgo...)
Oh... (Virgo...)

I wish I could look in your eyes, and tell you how I feel right now, inside;
Baby, I know that it's real (real), so real (real), so real (real), so real...

Mmm... (Miss you...)
How I wish I could be with you...
(I miss you...)
How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I could be with you right now...

Every morning, every afternoon, every night, I wanna be with you;
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play, stay in a hotel room all day,
I just wanna be with you...
I love everything about you, from your old-school tennis shoes,
To the way you move when you're dancing with me...

Do you remember our first kiss? It wasn't long enough...
Remember the first time we spent those weeks together? They were not long enough...
All of our conversations, all of your sweet pages, they're never long enough...

When it's time for me to leave, it's so hard to say good-bye;
I never want to say good-bye... I never ever want to say good-bye...

One day, we'll make love;
Finally, I'll be yours...
Only you, only you - I could love you...
But it's too late: I already love you...
I love you (I love you), I love you (I love you), I love you... (I love you...)''''''''''''''''''''
