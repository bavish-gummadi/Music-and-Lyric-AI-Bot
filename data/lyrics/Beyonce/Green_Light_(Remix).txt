Give it to mama mama (oh)

(Verse 1: Beyonce)
For some strange reason (huh)
You done pleasin me like it's ok (Oh oh ooh)
Like a perm that's been left too long
It's like a burn
The result is it just won't take (Oh oh ooh)
I can see
Now it's all coming so clear to me now
I can see
Misinterpreted all of my naiveness
Was just thinking if I had no you
Than I can't do
My stock just went up over 2 million

(Chorus: Beyonce)
So if you want to (uh uh huh uh uh)
You got the green light (uh uh huh uh uh)
So if you want to (uh uh huh uh uh)
You got the green light (uh uh huh uh uh)
So if you want to (want to, want to) (uh uh huh uh uh)
You got the green light (uh uh huh uh uh)
So if you want to (uh uh huh uh uh)
You got the green light (uh uh huh uh uh)
Give it to mama

Go go go goooo

(Verse 2: Beyonce)
Some sillies say I should be trophied
'Cause it gets no stronger (Oh oh ooh)
Ladies y'all know (yeah girl y'all know)
This pimp ish gets no older
Is that a threat (what's another threat)
Yep! (that's another threat)
From you, you can get no colder
You got the green light (whoa)
And you can't ride (whoa)
You holdin' up traffic
Green means go!

(Chorus: Beyonce)
Go go go goooo
Go go go goooo
Go go go goooo
Go go RED LIGHT (I said you're holdin' up traffic green means go!) GREEN LIGHT!

(Verse 3: Beyonce)
I gave all I could give
My love, my heart (my heart)
Now we're facing the end (the end) of what you did from the start
My love

(Verse 4: Young Buck)
I can see from the green light you ready to go
You know I slowed down once but I won't no mo'
Baby girl hold on, better buckle your seat belt
I told you to holla when he melts
I know he tried to buy your heart with a black car
Big old mansion with a big old backyard
But if he was that smart
Homeboy would already know
You're the queen of your team, the hos got to go
Shorty lets roll if you ready to ride
You've been parked to long, let me put it in drive
Ain't nothin' like thug love, and that's real
I'm a lay back, you grab the wheel
I can handle it
Get the candles lit
Got to take advantage of every chance you get
So if y'all ain't hear me B let 'em know

(Instrument Solo)

(You're holdin' up traffic, GREEN MEANS GO!)

(Chorus: Beyonce)
So if you want to (Whoa oh oh!) (uh uh huh uh uh)
You got the green light (Whoa oh oh!) (uh uh huh uh uh)
So if you want to (Whoa oh!) (uh uh huh uh uh)
You got the green light (Whoa oh oh!) (uh uh huh uh uh)
So if you want to (Go!) (want to, want to) (uh uh huh uh uh)
You got the green light (Go go go go!) (uh uh huh uh uh)
So if you want to (uh uh huh uh uh)
You got the green light (uh uh huh uh uh)
Give it to mama

So why not move along
You want a green light... so you can... GO! (go, go, go)

Go go go goooo

Go go go goooo
Go go RED LIGHT (ah) GREEN LIGHT!''''''''''''''''''
