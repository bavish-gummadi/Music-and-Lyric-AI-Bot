I remember being young and so brave, I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back daydreaming
Look at me, I'm a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town, now, bitches, I run this... Ah!

'Cause I put it (down like that, put down like that)
And I'm makin' (all these racks, all these racks)
And I'm movin' (round like that, round like that)
When I do it, (I don't look back, don't look back)

I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want (But of course!)
I can be bad if I want, I can do wrong if I want
I can live fast if I want, I can go slow all night long
I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want

They love the way I walk, 'cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk, 'cause I ain't pretending
It took a while, now I understand just where I'm goin'
I know the world and I know who I am, it's 'bout time I show it... Ah!

'Cause I put it (down like that, put down like that)
And I'm makin' (all these racks, all these racks)
And I'm movin' (round like that, round like that)
When I do it, (I don't look back, don't look back)

I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want (But of course!)
I can be bad if I want, I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want, I can go slow all night long
I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want

I'm a grown woman (I'm grown)
And I know that I got it (Got it, got it)
I'm a grown woman (I'm grown)
Ain't got no room in my pockets (Ah)
I'm a grown woman (I'm grown)
Look down, got you so excited

I'm a grown woman (I'm grown)
So I know how to ride it (Ride it, ride it)
I'm a grown woman (I'm grown)
And I'm so erotic (Ah)
I'm a grown woman (I'm grown)
Look down, got you so excited
I'm a grown woman (I'm grown)
Look at my body

I really wanna know if you got it like that
'Cause you got a cute face, and that booty so fat

It ain't no fun, if a girl can't have none
You really wanna know how I got it like that?
'Cause I got a cute face and my booty so fat

Go girl! (Go, girl) She got that bomb, that bomb
That girl (That girl) can get whatever she wants
That girl (That girl!), she got that tight, that tight
Them boys (Them boys), they do whatever what she likes

I'm a grown woman
I'm a grown woman

(I'm a grown woman, I can do whatever I want)
I can do what's in ever I want!
(I'm a grown woman)
Bitch, I'm grown!
(I can do whatever I want)
Bitch, I'm grown

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Keep goin'!
(I'm a grown woman! I can do whatever I want!)
(I'm a grown woman! I can do whatever I want!)
(I'm a grown woman! I can do whatever I want!)
(I'm a grown woman! I can do whatever I want!)
(I'm a grown woman! I can do whatever I want!)
(I'm a grown woman! I can do whatever I want!)
(I'm a grown woman! I can do whatever I want!)
(I'm a grown woman! I can do whatever I want!)
(I'm a grown woman! I can do whatever I want!)''''''''''''''''''
