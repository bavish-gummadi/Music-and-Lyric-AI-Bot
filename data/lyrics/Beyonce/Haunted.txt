The winner is Beyonce Knowles
Female pop vocalist!

I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love
I love you Houston

And I've been drifting off of knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks
Man these women getting solemn
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wander
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge
I preach my gut it can't help ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls 'cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring
All these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm touring
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
How come?

What goes up
Ghost around
Ghost around

What goes up
Ghost around
Ghost around...

Soul not for sale
Prob'ly won't make no money off this
Oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so... Umh

It's what you do
It's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

You want me?
I walk down the hallway
You lucky?
The bedroom's the wrong way
Slap me, I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm on to you
You must be on to me

It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you

You must be onto me
(Onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me
(Onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me
(Onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me
(Onto you, I'm onto you)

Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)''''''''''''''''''
