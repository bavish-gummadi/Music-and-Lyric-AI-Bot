Took me a while
But I'm finally here
So I just wanna testify
Make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out
To be picked on
Talked bout outta me friends mouth
I've been beat down
Till he turned my life around
(Turn my life around)

Seems like I always fall short
Of bein worthy
'Cause I ain't good enough
But he still loves me


I ain't no superstar
The spotlight ain't shinin on me
(No no no no no)
'Cause I ain't good enough
But he still loves me
Loves me

(Beyonce)
I used to wake up somedays
And wish I'd stayed asleep
'Cause I went to bed on top of the world
Today the worlds on top of me
Everybody's got opinions
(They share)
They ain't been in my position
(They don't care)
That it breaks my heart when I hear what they
Have to say about me yeah
(What they say)

Seems like I always fall short (fallin' short)
Of bein worthy (Lord I ain't worthy)
'Cause I ain't good enough (no no)
But he still loves me (still loves me)

I ain't no superstar
I wanna be for you
The spotlight ain't shinin on me
(But I want to be for you)
'Cause I ain't good enough
But he still loves me

I'm not perfect
(I'm not perfect)
Yes I do wrong
(Yes I do wrong)
I'm trying my best
(Trying my best but)
But it ain't good enough
(Just ain't good enough)
Shunned by the world
(Shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed
'Cause I ain't good
But he still loves me
(I just ain't good enough)

If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed
To be loved, loved

Stand for him or fall for anything
'Cause through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do
Without out pain

Feels like we always fall short
Of bein worthy (we are not worthy)
'Cause I ain't good enough
But he still loves me
I ain't no superstar
(I ain't no superstar but I wanna be for you Lord)
The spotlight ain't shinin on me
'Cause I ain't good enough
(Oh)
But you still love me

I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm tryin' my best but
(Tryin' my best)
It ain't good enough
(I'm not good enough)
Shunned be the word
(Shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed
(I don't succeed-ceed-ceed)
'Cause I ain't good enough
But he still loves me
(Child sing with me)
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm tryin' my best but
It ain't good enough
(But the Lord's been so good to me)
Shunned be the word
(Shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed
'Cause I ain't good enough
(I ain't good enough)
But he still loves me
(The Lord still loves me)

No I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
(Raise your hands if ya understand)
No I ain't good enough
(How he blessed you 'cause he blessed you too)
But He still loves me
(Even though I ain't worthy)
No I ain't good enough
(You ain't worthy, He's there for you)
But He still loves me
(No matter what I do)
No I ain't good enough
(I ain't good enough)
But he still loves me
(But the Lord still loves me)''''''''''''''''''
