Heavy, heavy
You got so heavy, baby
Heavy, heavy
You got so heavy on me

You used to be
So light and free
You used to smile just looking at me
Now all you give
Is jealous hate
C'mon, baby baby, loose some weight

Heavy, heavy
You got so heavy, baby (yeah, yeah)
Heavy, heavy
You got so heavy on me

Heavy, heavy
You got so heavy, baby (yeah, yeah)
Heavy, heavy
You got so heavy on me

You used to want
Nothing from me
You used to say, "Let's both be free"
You used to dance
Instead of walk
You never had to talk, talk, talk

Heavy, heavy (talk, talk, talk)
You got so heavy baby (talk, talk, talk)
Heavy, heavy (talk, talk, talk)
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy''''''''''''''''''''
