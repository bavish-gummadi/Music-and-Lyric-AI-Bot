I love to see you walk into the room
Body shining lightin' up the place
And when you talk, everybody stop
'Cause I know you know just what you sayin'

The way that you protect your friends
Baby I respect you for that
And when you grow you'll take everyone you love along
I love that shit

Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart
You shelter my soul, you're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know

You had me at hello
Hello, hello
You had me at hello
Hello, hello

It was many years ago
Baby when you stole my cool
'Cause you had me at hello
Hello, hello

I get so excited when you travel with me
Baby while I'm on my grind
And never will I ever let my hustle
Come between me and my family time and

You keep me humble, I like this type
'Cause you know there's more to life
And if I need ya, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart
You shelter my soul, you're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know

You had me at hello
Hello, hello
You had me at hello
Hello, hello

It was many years ago
Baby when you stole my cool
You had me at hello
Hello, hello

Gotta feel you and be near you
You're the air that I breathe to survive
Gotta hold you, wanna show you
That without you my sun doesn't shine

You don't have to try so hard for me to love you
Boy without you my life just ain't the same
You don't have to try so hard for me to love you

You had me at hello
Hello, hello
You had me at hello
Hello, hello

It was many years ago
When you stole my cool
You had me at hello
Hello, hello

It was many years ago
Baby, when you stole my cool
You had me at hello
Hello, hello''''''''''''''''
