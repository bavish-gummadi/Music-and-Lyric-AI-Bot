Mekhi:
Yo, we grew up together, we cut school together
When we have kids, go through terrible two's together

Reagan:
And when they turn three we'll be watchin' the news together
Cop found slain that kind of pain last forever

Mekhi:
So what you me to be, huh?

Reagan:
A man of your family

Mekhi:
What? Soccer dad, Saturdays, load up the Camry?

Reagan:
If I ever lost you the next would be my sanity
A house without you is not a home
It's more like Amityville

Mekhi:
Come on, Caela, you need to play fair, like vanity
You're the only woman that I speak with so candidly
You're the only woman I've been with, how can it be?
There's other fish inside the sea, but none can swim beside you, see
But becomin' a cop is like becomin a man to me

Reagan:
And if you get shot then you'll become a body bag, you see
I love more than slaves love the thought of bein' free

Mekhi:
What, you and me?

Reagan:
Simpson

Mekhi:
Ashford

Both:
Eternally

Reagan:
What about a desk job
You still protect and servin' me
'Cause I don't wanna get that call from the infirmary
Thoughts of your surgery constantly disturbin' me

Mekhi:
But possibly a captian, your pessimism's concernin' me
You know I love you I don't have to say it verbally
Wouldn't leave you in Berlin in post-war Germany

Reagn:
Somethin' just occurred to me

Mekhi:
Listen, only emergencyis me and you inside the bedroom
With some urgency''''''''''''''''
