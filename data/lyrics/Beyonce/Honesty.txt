If you search for tenderness, it isn't hard to find;
You can have the love you need to live...
But if you look for truthfulness, you might just as well be blind -
It always seems to be so hard to give...

Honesty is such a lonely word;
Everyone is so untrue...
Honesty is hardly ever heard,
And mostly what I need from you...

I can always find someone to say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve...
But I don't want some pretty face to tell me pretty lies;
All I want is someone to believe...

Honesty is such a lonely word;
Everyone is so untrue...
Honesty is hardly ever heard,
And mostly what I need from you...

I can find a lover, I can find a friend;
I can have security until the bitter end...
Anyone can comfort me with promises again, I know...

When I'm deep inside of me, don't be too concerned;
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone...
But when I want sincerity, tell me, where else can I turn,
When you're the one that I depend upon?

-Esty is such a lonely word;
Everyone is so untrue...
Honesty is hardly ever heard;
Mostly what I need from you...''''''''''''''''
