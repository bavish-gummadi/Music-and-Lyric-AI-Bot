It's really been weighing on me,
Tell me what did I do?
To have y'all hatin' on me,
When I don't have nothin' to prove.
Sometimes I shake my head,
When I'm layin' down in my bed.
Thinkin' 'bout the things been said,
When you really don't know me yet.

Gotta clear up some things
There have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved.
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya,
Give it a rest.
You must admire me,
Spend so much time with me consuming your head.

(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out.
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies.
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, ooh

It's really been weighing on me,
I'm not myself lately.
I feel a little incomplete,
But I'm not gonna lose no sleep.
I keep it all in my mind,
Cause it gotta get better in time.
Why don't you live your life?
And let me live mine.

Yoou, yoou, yoou, don't know,
