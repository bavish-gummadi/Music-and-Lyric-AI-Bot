I told you how you hurt me, baby, but you don't care;
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby, but you don't care...
Can't nobody tell me this is love, when you're immune to all my pain;
I need you to tell me this is love - You don't care, well, that's okay...

Well, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la, la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...)
Oh, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la, la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...) Aow!

Ever since you knew your power, you made me cry,
And now, every time our love goes sour, you won't sympathize...
You see these tears fallin' down to my ears - I swear, you like when I'm in pain, yeah;
I try to tell you all my fears, huh! You still don't care - that's okay...

Hey... well, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la-la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...)
Oh, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care... Yeah...
(La-la-la, la-la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...) Aow!

Boy, maybe if you cared enough, I wouldn't have to care so much...
What happened to our trust? Now you're just givin' up;
You used to be so in love - now you don't care no more!

Well, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la, la...) Baby! (La-la-la, la-la la...)
Oh, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la...) Baby! (La-la-la, la-la-la...) I still care!
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La-la-la, la-la-la...) I still care!
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La-la-la, la-la-la...) I still care!
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La-la-la, la-la-la...) Aow!
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La-la-la, la-la-la...) I still care!
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La-la-la, la-la-la...)''''''''''''''''''
