I thought that things like this get better with time, but I still need you... Why is that?
You're the only image in my mind, so I still see you around...

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away...
Said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

The words don't ever seem to come out right, but I still mean them... Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel, but I still need to... Why is that?

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away...
I said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...
No matter who you love, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away... (But you're away...)
I said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...
No matter who you love, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...''''''''''''''''''
