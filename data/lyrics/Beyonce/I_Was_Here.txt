I want to leave my footprints on the sands of time;
Know there was something that meant something that I left behind...
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets,
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I will leave my mark so everyone will know - I was here...

I want to say I lived each day until I die,
And know that I meant something in somebody's life...
The hearts that I touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I will leave my mark so everyone will know...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I will leave my mark so everyone will know - I was here...

I just want them to know that I gave my all, did my best, brought someone some happiness,
Left this world a little better, just because I was here...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I want to leave my mark so everyone will know...

I was here;
(I lived,) I lived... (I loved...)
I was here...
(I did,) I did! (I've done...)
I was here!
(I lived,) I lived... (I loved) I loved!
I was here... (Oh, ooh, ooh...)
I did, I've done...
I was here.''''''''''''''''''
