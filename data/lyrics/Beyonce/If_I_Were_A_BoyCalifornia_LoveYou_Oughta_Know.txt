If I were a boy even just for one day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted
And go drink beer with the guys

And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they stick up for me

Oh, if I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taking her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone, yeah right

I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
To come home, to come home, to come home

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you, you thought wrong

I want you to know that I'm happy for you
And I want nothing but the best for you both
And all the version of me, Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
Baby, weren't you thinking of me when you, what?

'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died
Till you died but you're still alive

And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross you bear when you did that
You, you, you oughta know

It's for just a boy, baby, you don't understand
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed''''''''''''''''''
