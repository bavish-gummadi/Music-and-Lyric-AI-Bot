(Feat. Lee Carr)

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll oudda bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it.
'Cause they'd stick up for me.

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man.
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a girl
Even just for a day
I'd get oudda bed in the mornin'
And take forever to ready.
Complain to my friends
As if they got a man. (Oh)
They talk about you 'cause they jealous,
I just steady listen to it
I should get rid of them.

If I were a girl
I don't think I'd understand
How it feels to love a boy
I swear I'd be a better woman.
I'd listen to him
'Cause I don't know everything.
I would always try to tell em
That he needs to treat me better
Like I don't godda change at all.
If I were a girl

It's a little too late for you to come back (No)
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that (I don't)
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong (I'm better off)

But you're just a boy
And you're just a girl
You don't understand (No)
Yeah you don't understand (Oh)
How it feels to love a girl someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
And you don't listen to him
You don't care how it hurts
You don't care how I feel
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
But you're just a boy
And you're just a girl''''''''''''''''''
