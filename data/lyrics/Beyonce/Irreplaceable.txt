To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left, mmm

To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it, nigga, please don't touch (don't touch)

And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standin' in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?

Because you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standin' in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
Got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable

(Irreplaceable, irreplaceable)
So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you? (nothing, no nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you... (I won't shed a tear...)
I won't lose a wink of sleep, 'cause the truth of the matter is 
Replacing you is so easy

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left, mmm
To the left, to the left, everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin', baby, hey hey

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
'Cause I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me, nigga, pack all yo' bags, we finished
You must not know 'bout me, 'cause you made your bed, now lay in it
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
