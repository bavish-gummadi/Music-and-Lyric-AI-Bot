(Feat. Trina)

(Beyonce:)
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me

(Trina:)
Ughh taxi come pick this nigga up; a used condom in his truck
Used to trick it wit tha sluts; tellin' me I'm number 1
But you was better than tha rest; truth be told u'z a mess
Who loved tha playin' games; rollercoaster wit my brain
I'd cry myself to sleep 'cause it hurt so bad
I'm askin how could you expose everythin' we had
Now I gotta go inside the little black bag
I bet he'll be back tryna wave tha white flag
Nigga-nerve of you sayin' I wouldn't find another
U don't bump yo head, u gon need me sucka
Changin my number; I ain't thinkin' 'bout you
I'm in love wit myself; if you wanna know tha truth

(Beyonce:)
In tha closet... that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it babii please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And It's my mine name that is on that Jag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool - Talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me

(Beyonce and Trina:)
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute babii

(Trina:)
Keep talkin' slick...
Ones a killa; ones a drug deala
One who wines *&* dines me wit million dollar even tho rap it to equality
I even know a rapper who wanna dig in it
Or my football playa friend whose been beggin me to end it
My attorney on Brickle wit a big popsicle
Who ain't neva had a hard time aimin at tha middle
MY NBA All Star who make it wit a sizzle
That's tha shizzle my nizzle; he think his time when he nibble
Don't make me remind u; to tha left, to tha left

(Beyonce:)
Everythin' you own in tha box to tha left
In tha closet... that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it babii please don't touch
And keep talkin' that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at tha same time
And It's my mine name that is on that Jag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab

Standing in tha front yard tellin' me
How I'm such a fool - Talkin' bout
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me

I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute babii

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me

I could have another you by tomorrow
So, don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'; u're irreplaceable

So, go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick *&* see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Cause you was untrue
Rolling her around in tha car that I bought u
Baby you dropped them keys; hurry up before ur taxi leaves
Standing in tha front yard telling me
How I am such a fool - Talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like u
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me

I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute babii

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me

I could have another you by tomorrow
So, don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'; u're irreplaceable

So since I'm not ur everything
How about I'll be nothing
Nothing at all to u
Baby I won't shead a tear for u
I won't lose a wink of sleep
Cause tha truth of tha matter is
Replacing you is so easy

To tha left, to tha left
To tha left, to tha left
To tha left, to tha left; everythin' you own in a box to tha left
To tha left, to tha left;
Don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'; u're irreplaceable

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me

I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be be here in a minute - babii

You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinkinnnnnn...

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me

I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be be here in a minute

You can pack all ur bagsss
We're finished
You made ur bed; now lay in it

I could have another you by tomorrow
So, don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'; u're irreplaceableeee''''''''''''''''''
