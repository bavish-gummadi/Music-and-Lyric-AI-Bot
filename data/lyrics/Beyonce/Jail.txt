(Beyonce)

I live my life to the fullest
Party every chance I get
Friday nights, "The Spot" is the place I hit
Decked out, chest out
Me and my girls roll up in "The Spot" like we own the world
You should see the eyes on me, dress fittin' like a prize on me
High split, fellas get the rise on me
Just from the looks of it, I must say
You're bound to get hooked on it, if you play

(Mekhi)

Your optomistic for someone goin' to jail

(Beyonce)

Would you stop bein' so damn stale
I know you gotta girl but damn don't you wanna see new things
Security shouldn't purchase a ring

(Mekhi)

So why you lookin' at me like that?
Like what you say is true?

(Beyonce)

I know your type I see through you

(Mekhi)

Oh yeah? What you see??
'Cause I love my girl it's not about security I give her the world
She's down for and always has been

(Beyonce)

And I would be, too, if I was your girlfriend
But I'm not
I even take you too "The Spot", bring sand to the beach, keep you on a leash,
I know how thirsty these chicks could be
Schemin and plottin on you, like me

(Mekhi)

Listen, you a little too hot for a guy like me
You and I are unlikely
My girl is more like me she just cool, you know?
Not a risk-taker she just goes with the flow

(Beyonce)

She's wack You need a little spice in ya life
Live a little you'll see what you want in a wife is in me
I'm tellin' you it's like gold,
Hard to let go, Harder to hold
I'll dance with you slowly, too a hip-hop joint
And only stop on a positive, you got the point?

(Mekhi)

I don't dance, I don't drink I don't like clubs I'm not impressed
I don't smoke, only scrubs go to different places and fall for pretty faces,
To me, y'all are all basic

(Beyonce)

And your life is wasted,
That's why you're a cop
You never got to taste it if you had one drop,
You wouldn't go back
I'll prove it to you,
Come out with me tonight, that'll do it for you''''''''''''''''
