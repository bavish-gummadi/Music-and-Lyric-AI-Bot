I'm in my penthouse half naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at
Just one shot left of this drink
In this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise
And I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling
That's because I'm jealous

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
Baby girl you can't survive like this

Take it one step further
Freakum dress out my closet
Beyonc fillin' out this skirt
I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat
Boy, you'll been hanging out alright tonight
I'm staying out till tomorrow
Been dancing on them tables
Ain't got no cares, no sorrows
I ran into my ex
Said what up to his bestest
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas
Don't be jealous

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh you're jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh you're jealous

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
Baby girl you can't survive like this no, no, no

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous''''''''''''''''''
