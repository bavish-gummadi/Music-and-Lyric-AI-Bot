Ooh
I know that you
Treat me right
But still I think I gotta
Make you my next ex
I'm on to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else
I like
And I think I Gotta
Make you my next ex
I'm on to the next
Ooh

Today when I wake up
You didn't look the same
As last night
And it just don't feel
Right anymore
I think
That we should break up
There's no reason
To make up
I won't fight
I'm just tired
And I need a change

Sorry Boy But You've
Got me bored
And something
Cathing my eye
I was only satisfied
For a little while

I gotta
Switch 'em out (4x)

Kick him out (4x)
Woahoooah, ooh

I know that you
Treat me right
But still I think I gotta
Make you my next ex
I'm on to the next
And I think you're nice
But I saw something else
That I like
I really think I gotta
Make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
Ooh

You call me
Too frequently
I thought it was
So sweet
In the beginning
But now You're too clingy
For me
You don't put the
Seat down
You don't clean the house
How I like it,(tryfling)
That's reason enough
You're time's expired

Sorry Boy But you've
Got me bored
I gotta move
Around
If I ain't
Gotta ring by now
That means
I'm not tied down

I gotta
Switch 'em out (4x)
(Ooh, ooh)

Kick him out (4x)
Woahoooah, ooh

I know that you
Treat me right
But still I think I gotta
Make you my next ex
(Next ex)
I'm on to the next

And I think you're nice
But I saw something else
That I like
I really think I gotta make you my next ex
I'm one to the next
Ooh

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Switch 'em out (4x)

Kick him out (4x)
