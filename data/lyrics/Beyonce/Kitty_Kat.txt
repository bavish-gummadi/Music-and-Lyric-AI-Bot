You know I hate sleepin' alone,
But you said that you would soon be home,
But, baby, that was a long time ago...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

On top of you not calling me back,
You see, I bet you think it's all on track,
And you actin' like it's alladat...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

Let's go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
I think it's time to go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
He don't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Quite frankly: (No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it...)

It's like we at two places, but different paces;
We in trouble, but you won't meet me at the bridge...
It hurts, and feels discerning;
Did you forget where your heart lives?

What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body;
Acting like I'm not nobody - You gon' make me call somebody...
What about my body, body? What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party - somehow, somewhere, I'll be naughty...

You know I hate sleeping alone,
But you said that you would soon be home,
But, baby, that was a long time ago...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

On top of you not calling me back,
You see, I bet you think it's all on track,
And you actin' like it's alladat...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

Let's go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
I think it's time to go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Heon't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Quite frankly: (No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it...)

(Let me show you how to get there.)
Take a left to compassion (lights will be flashin')
Keep straight and you'll see the sign right there:
Affection... (You're in the wrong direction...)
If I get caught, see, it just seems that you don't care...

What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body;
Acting like I'm not nobody - You gon' make me call somebody...
What about my body, body? What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party - somehow, somewhere, I'll be naughty...

You know I hate sleeping alone,
But you said that you would soon be home, (You said you would soon be home...)
But, baby, that was a long time ago...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

On top of you not calling me back,
You see, I bet you think it's all on track,
And you actin' like it's alladat... (Yo' sex ain't all that...)
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...) Let's go!

Let's go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
I think it's time to go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Heon't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Quite frankly: (No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it...)

I'm taking back the things I got from you, you,
And that includes my sweet little nookie too, too...

Let's go... (Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat;)
Kitty Kat. (He don't want you anymore... no...)
Uh, uh, uh...
Let's go... (Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat;)
Kitty Kat. (He don't want you anymore... no...)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

Rap:
Rock diamonds on my neck, got diamonds on my records;
Since 16, I was coming down ridin' Lexus'.
How you gon' neglect this? You is just a hot mess;
You can call Tyrone - You ain't gots to lie, Craig!

What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body?
I'm in the house all alone, you rather go and party?
What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body?
Acting like I'm nobody - You gon' make me call somebody...

Let's go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
I think it's time to go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
He ain't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it.'''''''''''''''''''
