Ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-ba-da, 
Ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-ba... ba-ba-ba... Bring the beat in!

Honey, honey, I can see the stars all the way from here;
Can't you see the glow on the windowpane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near;
Every time you touch me, I just melt away...

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear;
(People say "Love hurts,") but I know (it's gonna take a little work...) Whoa-oh!
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fightin' through my tears,
And finally, you put me first!

Baby, it's you! 
You're the one I love (one I love), you're the one I need! (I need...)
You're the only one I see!
Come on, baby, it's you! (It's you...)
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one I can always call! (Always call...)
When I need you, make everything stop - Finally, you put my love on top!
Ooh! Come on, baby! 
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top...
You put my love on top!
Ooh-ooh! Come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top, put my love on top, my love on top...

Baby, baby, I can hear the wind whipping past my face,
As we dance the night away...
And boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne, 
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again...

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear;
(People say "Love hurts,") but I know (that's it's gonna take a little work...) Oh-whoa, oh...
Nothin's perfect, but it's worth it after fightin' through my tears,
And finally, you put me first!

Baby, it's you! 
You're the one I love (one I love), you're the one I need! (I need...)
You're the only one I see!
Come on, baby, it's you! (It's you...) 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one I can always call! (Always call...)
When I need you, make everything stop - Finally, you put my love on top!
Ooh! Baby! 
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top...
You put my love on top!
Ooh-ooh! Come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top, put my love on top, my love on top...

Baby, it's you! 
You're the one I love (one I love), you're the one I need! (I need...)
You're the only thing I see!
Come on, baby, it's you! (It's you...) 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one that always calls! (Always call...)
When I need you, baby, everything stops - Finally, you put my love on top!

Baby! You're the one that I love! Baby, you're all I need!
You're the only one I see!
Come on, baby, it's you! 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one I always call! (Calls...)
When I need you, everything stops - Finally, (you put my) love on top!

Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love! Baby, you're the one that I need!
You're the only man I see...
Oh, baby, baby, it's you! 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one that always calls... (Calls...)
When I need you, everything stops - Finally, you put my love on top!

Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love! (Love!) Baby, you're the one that I need! (Need!)
You're the only one I see... (See...)
Oh, baby, baby, it's you! 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one that always calls! (Call...)
When I need you, everything stops - Finally, you put my love on top!''''''''''''''''''
