All in all you've been there for me
You showed me things I would never see
I think I'm ready
By my side you been waitin'
Respectfully and oh so patient
I think I'm ready

I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control
You haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why
I think I'm ready

Baby I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time and
Baby I know you wanna change the speed and
I'ma let you take the lead
But it's my first time and
Baby I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time and
Baby I know you wanna change the speed and
I'ma let you take the lead
Remember it's my first time

Arm in arm eye to eye
As the music plays emotions rise
I think I'm ready
In your eyes I see three words
Hold me tight 'cause I'm about burst
I think I'm ready

I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control
You haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why
I think I'm ready

Baby I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time (it's my first time ah ah)
Baby I know you wanna change the speed and
I'ma let you take the lead
But it's my first time (remember your first time ah ah)
And baby I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time and (it's my first time ah ah)
Baby I know you wanna change the speed and
I'ma let you take the lead
Remember it's my first time

It felt like

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah''''''''''''''''''
