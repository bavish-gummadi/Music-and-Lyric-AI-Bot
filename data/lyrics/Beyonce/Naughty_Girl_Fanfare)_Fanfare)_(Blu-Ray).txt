I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby

I'm feeling sexy
I want to hear you say my name, boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame

Feeling kind of horny
I might just take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
The vibe is just takin' over me
To start feelin' so crazy, babe
Lately I feel the funk comin' over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy, babe

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We're gon' turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
Tonight I'm calling all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

You're so sexy; tonight I am all yours, boy
The way your body moves across the floor, boy

Feeling kind of horny
I might just take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
The vibe is just takin' over me
To start feelin' so crazy, babe
Lately I feel the funk comin' over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy, babe

I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby''''''''''''''''''
