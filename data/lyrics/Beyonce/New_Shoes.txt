Hey honey
Cat got your tongue
Don't look so funny
This took comedian
Joke's on you
And you're good at bed
So where's my money
I know you're bad
And I would never make that move

So why's the house empty
Light's off by the end of this week
I'll leave with what I came with baby
I'll take jaws** you'll take the mercedes

'Cause I'm gone I'm not staying
I walked these roads with grace
And I'll wave with you behind me
With a new smile on my face
'Cause I'm walking in new shoes now
I got a new song to sing
When I walk in the room every head turns
Every eye is on me
To bad you're not here to see it
And by the time you get this
I was so long gone and far
I'll send you a postcard
Aha ill send you a postcard

Hey baby
You seem to ghost this ain't yo lady
This is the chick that you held back now
Now all of the things you've said were crazy
I checked out my list and I feel good about it
I got the new haircut
The one that you said that wouldn't look no good
Took that job you said I could not get
Wore that dress you said I'd never fit

'Cause you're gone and I'm great
I got rid of your dead way
And ill wave at you behind me
With a new smile on my face
'Cause I'm walking in new shoes now
I got a new song to sing
When I walk in the room every head turns
Every eye is on me
To bad you're not here to see it
And by the time you get this
I was so long gone and far
I'll send you a postcard''''''''''''''''''
