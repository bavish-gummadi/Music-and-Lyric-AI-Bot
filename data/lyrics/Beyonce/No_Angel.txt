Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm the problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

Because
You're
No
Angel
Either, baby
'Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
'Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
'Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby

No I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you late or when you're lying
I love you even more than who I thought you were before

Because
You're
No
Angel
Either, baby
'Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
'Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
'Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby

Tell me do you want to ride
Tell me do you want to ride
Ride around, ride around
Ride around
You ride around in that H-town
If there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First go through my legs, go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah baby I'll bet it comes true

Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm the problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

Because
You're
No
Angel
Either, baby
'Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
'Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
'Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby''''''''''''''''''
