This is just another day that I would spend waitin' for the right one,
Staring at the night, and wishin' I could be the one to feel the warm sun...

You're a dream, but I'm wide awake;
I'm in Heaven, for Heaven's sake...
So get ready (get ready), I'm ready now (get ready);
I could never need you more than now...

You were worth the waiting for,
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...

You were worth the waiting for,
You, the one that I adore...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...

Tell me that you're living in a place where no one else can find you;
Tell me that you're singing out my name, hoping that I'll hear you...

Tell me "no", and I'll fade away,
But this is lovin' that I won't waste...
So get ready (get ready), I'm ready now (get ready);
I could never need you more than now...

You were worth the waiting for,
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...

You were worth the waiting for,
You, the one that I adore...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...

"What are the words I'm needin' to hear?"
"How do I know if I'll ever love again?"
Seeing your face makes everything clear... (clear...) clear,
And I'll never be the same...

You were worth the waiting for,
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...

You were worth the waiting for,
You, the one that I adore...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...''''''''''''''''''''
