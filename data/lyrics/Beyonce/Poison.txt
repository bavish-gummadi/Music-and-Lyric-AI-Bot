Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You're bad for me
I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me
Must be yo mission 
'Cause with every hug and kiss 
You're snatching every bit of strength
That I'm gon' need to fight off the inevitable 
And it's a heartbreaking situation
I'm up in but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do, 
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Kiss me one more time before I die

You ain't right take me high
Then that high, it subsides 
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive 
Wait, wait, wait... I'm alive
But how long will it last 
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down?

Baby you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do 
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Kiss me one more time before I die

It's just not my body (No), it's my mind
You don't know how many times I told myself, this can't do (Can't do)
And that I don't need you (No I don't need you)
It's so unfair, (Unfair) that I find myself right back in your care (Care)
And what's good is that when you are not always there (there, there)
You're no good for my health, my health
You're just like poison (ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)
You're just like poison (ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)

Baby you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do 
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Baby kiss me one more time

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, ooh
You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Kiss me one more time before I die''''''''''''''''''''
