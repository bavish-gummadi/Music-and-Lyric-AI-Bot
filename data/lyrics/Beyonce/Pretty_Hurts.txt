Pageant Host/Harvey Keitel: "Miss Third Ward, your first question. What is your aspiration in life?"
Miss Third Ward/Beyonc: "Hoh... my aspiration in life? Would be... to be happy."

Mama said, "You're a pretty girl;
What's in your head, it doesn't matter...
Brush your hair, fix your teeth;
What you wear is all that matters..."

Just another stage, pageant the pain away;
This time, I'm gonna take the crown without falling down, down, down...

Pretty hurts;
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
Perfection is a disease of a nation;
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...

Pretty hurts;
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
You try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see;
It's the soul that needs the surgery...

Blonder hair, flat chest;
TV says, "Bigger is better..."
South Beach, sugar-free;
Vogue says, "Thinner is better..."

Just another stage, pageant the pain away;
This time, I'm gonna take the crown without falling down, down, down...

Pretty hurts; (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
Perfection is a disease of a nation;
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts... (Pretty hurts...)

Pretty hurts; (Pretty hurts...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
You try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see;
It's the soul that needs the surgery...

Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away;
The pain's inside, and nobody frees you from your body...
It's my soul, it's my soul that needs surgery;
It's my soul that needs surgery...

Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far,
Then you break when the fake facade leaves you in the dark
You're left with shattered mirrors, and the shards of a beautiful girl...

Pretty hurts; (Oh, oh...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst... (Pretty hurts...)
Perfection is a disease of a nation; (Pretty hurts...)
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...

Pretty hurts; (Pretty hurts...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst... (Oh! Oh, oh...)
You try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see; (Pretty hurts...)
It's the soul that needs the surgery...

When you're alone all by yourself, (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
And you're lying in your bed, (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Reflection stares right into you; (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
You stripped away the masquerade, (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
The illusion has been shed; (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)

Yes...''''''''''''''''''
