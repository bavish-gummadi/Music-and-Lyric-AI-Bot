I be on the hotline like errday, makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play;
You know I got my top back and my beat low, rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio...
Turn up my radio...

I think I'm in love with my radio, 'cause it never lets me down;
And I fall in love with my stereo whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,)
Whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...)
Whenever I hear that sound...

You're the only one that Papa allowed to hang out in my room;
With the door closed, we'd be alone...
And Mama never freaked out when she heard it go boom,
'Cause she knew we were in the zone...

Hold him in my arms, and look out of my window (under the moonlight),
And he'd be keeping me calm, so I never let him go;
He's got a place in my heart...

I think I'm in love with my radio, 'cause it never lets me down;
And I fall in love with my stereo (with my stereo-o-o...) whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...

When I get into my car, I turn it uh-uh, uh-up,
Then I hear vibrations all up in my truh-uh, uh-unk,
And the bassline be rattling through my se-ee, ee-ats,
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing, ee-ing, oh...
I get butterflies when I hear the DJ (playing the stuff I like)
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays;
He's got a place in my heart...

I think I'm in love with my radio, 'cause it never lets me down;
And I fall in love with my stereo whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...
