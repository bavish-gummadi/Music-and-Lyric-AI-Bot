Boy, you'll be the death of me;
You're my James Dean - You make me feel like I'm seventeen...
You drive too fast, you smoke too much,
But that don't mean a thing, 'cause I'm addicted to the rush...

('Cause I rather die young than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...
'Cause I rather die young (than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...

You know, I've been in love before;
You're the first one I ever seen that burns like gasoline...
So light a match, turn off the lights;
I'm holdin' on to you, 'cause this might be our last night, oh...

('Cause I rather die young than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...
'Cause I rather die young (than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...

What I'm tellin' you: I'm givin' you my life, it's in your hands,
And what I'm gonna do is be a woman, and you can be a man,
And I wanna say nobody understands what we been through;
I rather give up everything than to live my, live my life without you...

All!
All!

('Cause I rather die young than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...
'Cause I rather die young (than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...''''''''''''''''''
