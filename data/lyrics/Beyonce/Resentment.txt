I wish I could believe you, then I'd be all right
But now everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

Just can't seem to get over
The way you hurt me
I don't know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you and I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this (Forget this)
But I'm much too full of resentment (I'm much too full of resentment)

I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can and
I tried and I tried to forget this (Forget this)
I'm much too full of resentment

I'll always remember feeling (you lied) like I was no good (you lied)
Like I couldn't do it for you, like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied

Loved you more than ever (you lied)
More than my own life (you lied)
The best part of me I gave you (you lied)
It was sacrificed (Sacrificed)
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like (I can't go on and pretend)
I tried and I tried to forget this (I tried and I tried and I tried)
But I'm too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive but I was here first
I've been riding with you for six years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you
I know you probably thinking
"What's up with B?"
I've been crying for too long
What did you do to me?

I use to be so strong
Now you took my soul
I'm crying, can't stop crying
Can't stop crying

You could've told me
You wasn't happy
I know you didn't want to hurt me
But look what you've done to me now

I gotta look at her in her eyes (you lied)
And see she's had half of me (you lied)
How could you lie? (How could you lie?)''''''''''''''''''''''
