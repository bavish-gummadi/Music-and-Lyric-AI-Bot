Oh oh oh...
If I wrote a book about where we stand
The title of my book would be "Life with superman"
That's how you make me feel, I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal, I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same, I see it everyday
In all the things you do, and all the things you say

You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything I need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me

I want to kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do
You are my rock, I love to rock with you, I love to rock with you

If I were to try to count the ways you make me smile
I'd run out of fingers before I run out of time
The things to talk about, sugar you keeps it going
No nigga wanna keep my loving strong, And I'm gonna try my best to give you
What you want and what you need give you my whole heart not just a little piece
More than a minimum, I'm talking everything
More than a single wish, I'm talking every dream

You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything I need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me

I want to kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do
You are my rock, I love to rock with you, I wanna rock with you

If there's options, I don't want them
They're not worth my time
'Cause if it's not you, oh no thank you
I like us just fine
You're a rock in the sand
You're a smile in a cry
You're my joy through the pain
You're the truth through the lies
No matter what I do, I know that I can count on you

Oh, oh, oh

You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything I need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me

I want to kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do
You are my rock, I love to rock with you, I wanna rock with you

Oh, oh, oh

I want to kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do
You are my rock, I love to rock with you, I wanna rock with you''''''''''''''''''
