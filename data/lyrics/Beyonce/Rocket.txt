Let me sit this ass on you, show you how I feel;
Let me take this off, while you watch me - Yes, mass appeal...
Don't take your eyes, don't take your eyes off it;
Watch it, babe...
If you like, you can touch it, baby;
(Do you?) You know you wanna touch it, baby...
Ooh... Grab ahold, don't let go, let me know that you ready;
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around...
(You rock hard, I rock steady.)

And rock right up to the side of my mountain,
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak...
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain;
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep...
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow;
Hold me till I scream for air to breathe...
And wash me over until my well runs dry;
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me...

Rocket/rock it till waterfalls/water falls...
Rocket till waterfalls...
Rock it till water falls...
Bathe in these waterfalls

I do it like it's my profession - I gotta make a confession:
I'm proud of all this bass - baby, I'll put it in your face...
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist,
I can be your piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer;
Anything else that you may read between the lines, you and I create...
Rockets and waterfalls...

So rock right up to the side of my mountain,
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak...
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain;
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep...
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow;
Hold me till I scream for air to breathe...
And wash me over until my well runs dry;
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me...

Hard... rock. Steady... rock. Hard... rock. Steady... rock.
Hard... rock. Steady... rock. Hard... rock. Steady...

Don't you know that I give you your loving if you need it?
I give you my word, you can believe it...
Your love feels like all four seasons
Growing inside me - Life has a reason...
Swimming in my love, your love lifting,
Higher, harder, got me screaming to the lord, boy...
Kiss me - Pray we don't overflow, baby, I know you can feel it pulse,
Deep in the peak of my waterfall...
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, till the water falls... (Rockets and waterfalls...)

Damn.

I can't help but love the way we make love...

Daddy... Daddy... ooh, child. Ooh, now.
Yes, Lord. Damn, baby... You're driving me cray-cray...

You ain't right for doing it to me like that, Daddy,
Even though I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl...
Tell me, what you're gon' do about that?
(Punish me, please... Punish me, please...)
Daddy, what you gon' with all of this ass, all up in your face?
Yeah, hell yeah... (Love me so deep...)
Ooh, my shit's so good, it ain't even right... I know I'm right;
Hell yeah, you the shit - that's why you're my equivalent...
So sexy...

We're so much more than pointless fixtures, Instagram pictures,
Consumers... (What about that ching-ching-ching? What about that, what about that ching-ching?)
Baby boomers... (Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby...)
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in...
Home is where the heart is;
Goddammit, I'm comfortable in my skin,
And you're comfortable in my skin...
You look so comfortable in my skin, skin, skin... (Yeah... yeah...)
Rockets and waterfalls...''''''''''''''''''
