Satellites flashing by...

It's a beautiful state we're in, but how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try...

We're nothing like we seem - passionate words are never spoken;
You don't know how I bleed when I leave your side...

In your eyes, love's alive;
We've come untied 'cause we're flashing by... like satellites.
Satellites...

Take all the rules away - how can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display - let's run and hide...

In our eyes, love's alive;
We've come untied 'cause we're flashing by... like satellites.
Satellites...

If we don't communicate, we'll exist in our own space...
We have all the love we need
While we're apart, I cannot breathe...

Satellites flashing by...
Satellites...''''''''''''''''''''
