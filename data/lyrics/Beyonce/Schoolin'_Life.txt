This is for them twentysomethin's: Time really moves fast, you were just 16...
This is for them thirtysomethin's that didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be...
This is for them fortysomethin's: Well, raise up yo' glass and laugh like a motherfucker!
This is for them fiftysomethin's: Hell, you're halfway there, baby, take it to the head...

Mom and Dad tried to hide the world, said the world's just too big for a little girl;
Eyes wide open, can't you see? I had my first heels by the age of 13!
Mom and Dad tried to hide the boys - I swear, that just made 'em want me more;
At 14, they asked me what I wanna be - I said, "Baby, 21, so I get me a drink!"

I'm not a teacher, baby, but I can teach you somethin';
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna...
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better,
But I'm great at writin' physical love letters...

I'm a freak - all day, all night, ooh;
Hot top flight, boy, outta sight...
And I'm crazy all day, all night;
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...) Schoolin' life...
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...) Schoolin' life...

This is for them pretty somethin's livin' in the fast lane: See you when you crash, babe...
This is for them sexy somethin's: That body ain't gon' always get you out of everything...
This is for middle somethin's: Stop livin' in regret, baby, it's not over yet!
This is for them chipper somethin's that's high on life: Baby, put me on your flight!

I'm not a teacher, baby, but I can teach you somethin';
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna...
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better,
But I'm great at writin' physical love letters...

I'm a freak - all day, a-a-all night, ooh;
Hot top flight, boy, outta sight...
And I'm crazy all day, a-a-all night;
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...) Schoolin' life...
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...) Schoolin' life...

I know it costs to be the boss - One day, you'll run the town;
For now, make your life what you decide - Baby, party till the fire marshals shut this sucker down!

I'm not a teacher, baby, but I can teach you somethin';
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna... (Yeah...)
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better,
But I'm great at writin' physical love letters...

I'm a freak - all day, a-a-all night, ooh;
Hot top flight, boy, outta sight...
And I'm crazy all day, a-a-all night; (Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy...)
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...) Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-oh...) Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

There's not a real way to live this... for real;
Just remember to stay relentless... oh, yeah, oh, yeah...
Don't stop runnin' until it's finished... yeah, yeah, yeah...
It's up to you, the rest is unwritten... yay... ay... ay...'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
