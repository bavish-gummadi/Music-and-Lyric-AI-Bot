Don't treat me to these things of the world
(I'm not that kind of girl)
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve

Is a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms, say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost, I'll be gone
