Head down as I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut, I find myself in love racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love, love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

I wanna run, run
Smash into you
I wanna run, run
Smash into you

Ears closed, what I hear no one else has to know.
'Cause I know that what we have is worth first place in gold
And I'm soaked in your love, love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

I wanna run, run
Smash into you
I wanna run, run
Smash into you
Smash into you

Head down as I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut, I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love, love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

Oh, I wanna run
Smash into you
I'm willing to run, smash into you
I'm willing to run and run and run and run
R-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm willing to run and run and run and run
R-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
And I wanna run, run
Smash into you
I'm willing to run, run
Smash into you''''''''''''''''''''
