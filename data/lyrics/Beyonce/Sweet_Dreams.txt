(Turn the lights on) 

Every night I rest in my bed 
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you 
When I close my eyes 
I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hand and be my guide

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this? 

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you 
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true 
My guilty pleasure I ain't going nowhere 
Baby long as you're here 
I'll be floating on air 'cause you're my 
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you 

I mention you when I say my prayers 
I wrap you around all of my thoughts 
Boy you're my temporary high 
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby 
What kinda dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain't going nowhere
Baby long as you're here 
I'll be floating on air 'cause you're my 
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you

Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this? 

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you 
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true 
My guilty pleasure I ain't going nowhere 
Baby long as you're here
I'll be floating on air 'cause you're my, 
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you''''''''''''''''''
