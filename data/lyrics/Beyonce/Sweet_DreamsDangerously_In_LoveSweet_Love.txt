Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains, you're the perfect lullaby
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true

My guilty pleasure, I ain't going no where
Baby, long as you're here, I'll be floating on air 'cause you're my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you, wake up from you, you

Tattoo your name across my heart
Tattoo your name across my heart
Not even death can do us part
Not even death can do us part

Tattoo your name across my heart
Tattoo your name across my heart
Not even death can do us part
What kind of dream is this?

I love you, I love you, I love you

Baby I love you, you are my life
The happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation, connection to the sun
With you next to me there's no darkness I can't overcome

You are my raindrops, I am your sea
With you and God, who's the sunlight I'll bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
Make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world

I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave, just, just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me

Every time I see your face my heart smiles
Every time it feels so good it hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold
To feel, to breathe, to live you dangerously in love

Can't do this thing without you here with me
[Incomprehensible] loving me dangerously, dangerously
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love, I love you, I love, love, love you

With all my heart I love you, baby
Stay with me and you will see
My arms will hold you, baby
Never leave 'cause I believe

In this love, sweet love
Hear me calling out your name and I feel no shame
I'm in love, sweet love
Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way

There's no stronger love in this world
Oh baby, no, you're my man, I'm your girl
I'll never know, just wait and see, this can't be wrong
Don't you know this where you belong, oh

So sweet, so sweet, so sweet love
That's all I wanna know
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
That's all I wanna know

Just love me sweetly baby, just love me sweetly baby
Don't nobody know, ooh, ooh, ooh baby I
I'm in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you dangerously love''''''''''''''''''
