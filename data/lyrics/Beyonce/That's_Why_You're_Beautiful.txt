Diamonds used to be coal - look young 'cause they got soul,
And that's why they're beautiful...
And my heart used to be cold till your hands laid on my soul,
Baby, and that's why you're beautiful...

I'm not wondering why the sky's blue - that's not my business;
All I know is I look up and tell myself, "Be patient, love... that could be us..."

The lovers used to make love, not just to give us their piece of the beautiful...
Remember when we made love? Love... wasn't it beautiful?

Don't ask me why the sky's blue - that's not my business;
All I know is I look up and tell myself, "Be patient, love... that could be us..."

Diamonds used to be coal (be coal), look young 'cause they got soul (got soul),
And my heart used to be cold (be cold), till your hands laid on my soul... (my soul...)
Somebody's got to stay deep in love;
That could be us...
That's why we're beautiful...
That's why you're beautiful...

Ooh...
Oh, I... oh, I...

That's why we're beautiful...
That's why you're beautiful...
That's why you're beautiful...''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
