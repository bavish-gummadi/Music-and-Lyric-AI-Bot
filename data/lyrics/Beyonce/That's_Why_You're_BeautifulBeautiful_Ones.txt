Diamonds used to be coal
Look young 'cause they got soul
And that's why you're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
Till your hands laid on my soul
Baby, and that's why you're beautiful

I'm not wondering why the sky's blue
That's not my business
I look up and tell myself
Be patient, love, that could be us

Lovers used to make love
And die just to give us
A piece of their beautiful
Remember when we made love
Love, wasn't it beautiful?

Don't ask me why the sky's blue
That's not my business
I look up and tell myself
Be patient, love, that could be us

Diamonds used to be coal
Look young 'cause they got soul
And my heart used to be cold
Till your hands laid on my soul

Somebody's got to stay deep in love
That could be us
And that's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
