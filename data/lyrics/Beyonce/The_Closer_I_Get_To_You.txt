Luther Vandross
The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got (Tell me more)
Your love has captured me

Beyonc
Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
But all the while, inside, I knew it was real
The way you make me feel

Luther Vandross
Lyin' here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more (More and more)
Let's give love a try (Lets give love a try)
I wanna try love

Beyonc
Sweeter and Sweeter, love grows
And heavens there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts of Love will find
True love... in a special way

Luther Vandross
(Oh closer I get to you baby)
The more you make me see
By giving me what you've got

Both
Your love has captured me

Beyonc
Oh Over and Over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
But all the while, inside, I knew this was real (got to be) Got to be real...
The way you make me feel (you know you know you know)

Both
My baby My baby My baby... My love... oh... Yeah... (Come closer now)

Come a little closer so that we can see into the eyes of love (I want to see into those eyes of love)
Just a little closer... let me speak to you
I want to softly tell you something (Here I am and heres my love... I just want you)
Come a little closer. Let me whisper in your ear
'Cause I want to tell you something (I want to whisper in your ear... so soft... so come closer)
Move in real close so we can celebrate
The way we feel about eachother's loving (Want to tell you words...)''''''''''''''''''''
