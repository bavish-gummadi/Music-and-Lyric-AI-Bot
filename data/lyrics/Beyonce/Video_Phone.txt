Shawty what yo name is...

Them hustlers keep on talking
They like the way I'm walkin'
You're sayin' that you want me
So press record I'll let you film me

On ya video phone
Make a cameo
Tape me on your video phone
I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone
On your video, video
If you want me you can watch on your video phone

I love how you approach me
Fresh white with your pants hanging grown man low
Everything you sayin' soundin' good to me
No need to convince me anymore
Swag up it's right one blade it's tight
And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby you're doing something right
You just cancelled every other man here
You say you like my bag and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me
So I'mma leave my number on your video phone

I got no time for frontin'
I know just what I'm wantin'
If it's gonna be you and me
When I call they better see me on ya video screen

Them hustlers keep on talkin'
They like the way I'm walkin'
You're sayin' that you want me
So press record I'll let you film me

On ya video phone
Make a cameo
Tape me on your video phone
I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone
On your video, video
If you want me you can watch on your video phone

You a cutie
You should let me put you in my movies
Then shoot into a star of your own hit song
We can shoot the video right here on my cell phone
Never seen a smile so pretty
I need to know I'll always have it with me
So take your picture on my video phone
You can pick your own song
And you can be the only one
I know you like that
Turn you into a star
I got it like that
Baby don't fight it
'Cause when I miss your call
I hit you right back
On my video phone

Them hustlers keep on talkin'
They like the way I'm walkin'
You're sayin' that you want me
So press record I'll let you film me

On ya video phone
(Make a cameo)
Tape me on your video phone
(I can handle you)
Watch me on your video phone
On your video, video
If you want me you can watch on your video phone

You know them G's they be hollerin'
'Specially them hot ones
Brooklyn, Atlanta, Houston to New Orleans
When they see me
They be like "yo B let me call you"
You breakin' my focus
Boy you cute and you ballin'
You like it when I shake it
Shawty on a mission

What? You want me naked?
If you likin' this position
