Babe
Got to know one thing before you ask my name
Be straight up and tell me what's your aim
A girl like me see I don't play no games (no no)
That's why I say
If you want to be with me go all the way
Do what you go to do just in this stage
Is it real or is this just a fake
Tell me

What's good with you bay bay
Want to get to know me
What's really good bay bay
Do you have a lady
And name your hood bay bay
Where you from and where you be
What's good with you bay bay
What's good with you bay bay

Babe
Your sitting over there tryna figure out what to say
Make up your mind right now don't contemplate
You know that I don't have time to waste (no no)
Where do we go
What this thing could be we'll never know
There is just no way that we can flow
If you ain't being honest from the go (tell me)

What's good with you bay bay
Want to get to know me
What's really good bay bay
Do you have a lady
And name your hood bay bay


Where you from and where you be
What's good with you bay bay
What's good with you bay bay

Don't try playing with my mind
Boy I don't have no time
For something that I know ain't good for me
Don't hesitate to say
You feel the inner strength
Want to know
Should I take the chance with you

What's good with you bay bay
Want to get to know me
What's really good bay bay
If you have a lady
And name your hood bay bay
Where you from and where you be
What's good with you bay bay
What's good with you bay bay

What's good with you bay bay
Want to get to know me
What's really good bay bay
Do you have a lady
And name your hood bay bay
Where you from and where you be
What's good with you bay bay
What's really good bay bay

What's good with you bay bay
What's really good bay bay
And name your hood bay bay
What's good with you bay bay'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
