Hey, you, what's the deal? It's popping up in here
Wanna have a good time; just tryna chill
When I happened to notice how you're staring at me, ooh, baby, you're so fine
You deserve my time; with your sexy eyes you're qualified
So, boy, why don't ya, baby, why won't ya, come and talk to me?

Ooh, I wanna get closer
Ooh, baby, let me show ya
Ooh, I see you coming over making your move; I'm waiting on you to
Ooh, tell me what I wanna hear
Ooh, whisper something in my ear
Ooh, So you're making me feel sexy; baby, we can get up out of here

What's it gonna be, boy?
I'm watching you, you watching me
What's it gonna be, boy?
Can't you feel this chemistry?
What's it gonna be, boy?
It's so damn crowded we should leave
What's it gonna be, boy?
Tell me, what's it gonna be?

Can we take it there?
Club's about to close; give me one more dance, then I'm ready to go
When the deejay's playing all the same songs, then the night's about to end
Can we meet in the parking lot, find a quiet place where we can talk
To find out more about each other, baby, can we?

Ooh, I wanna get closer
Ooh, baby, let me show ya
Ooh, I'm glad you came over and made your move; now tell me what you wanna do
Ooh, tell me what I wanna hear
Ooh, whisper something in my ear
Ooh, You're making me feel sexy, baby, we should get up out of here

What's it gonna be, boy?
I'm watching you, you watching me
What's it gonna be, boy?
Can't you feel this chemistry?
What's it gonna be, boy?
This place is crowded; we should leave
What's it gonna be, boy?
Tell me, what's it gonna be?


You know I'm feeling you (I'm feeling you)
Tonight's on; let's find a spot (you feeling me)
To go so we can get to know each other better
