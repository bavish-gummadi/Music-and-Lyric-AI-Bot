Why Me Lord, What have I ever done
To deserve even one Of the Pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, What did I ever do
That was worth loving you Or the Kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me Jesus, My Soul's in your Hand.

Try me Lord, If you think there's a Way
I can try to repay All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself On my Way back to you.

Yes Lord, help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me Jesus, My Soul's in your Hand.

Jesus, My Soul's in your Hand, Amen''''''''''''''''
