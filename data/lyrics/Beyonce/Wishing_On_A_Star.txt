Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh
On A star

And I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes.
And I'm wishing on our love, the things we never done
I never thought I'd see a time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments that we can spend
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know,
In the game of love, you reap what you sow

I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
Whether or never
I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get together
And make the best of things, oh baby.
When we're together.
(Let's get together, baby)
Whether or never.

And I'm wishin on a star
To follow where you are
And I'm wishing on a dream''''''''''''''''''
