How ya doin', honey, baby?
You know I don't ask for much, but 
For a girl, spendin' time alone can be pretty rough...

But I get a knock on my door;
You know it's yours, for sure...
We can't wait for the bedroom, so we just hit the floor...

(Is y'all alright?) I don't know, but I know what's happened to me, girl, hey...
(Is y'all alright?) Uh... break it down now!

(Is y'all alright?) I don't know, but I know what's happened to me, girl...
(Is y'all alright?) Uh... break it down now!

See, you gotta work it out...
See, you gotta work it out...
A brotha gotta work it out...
Whoa, whoa, wow...

Chad, blow ya horn now!
C'mon, Chad, blow ya horn now!
Chad, blow ya horn now!
C'mon, Chad, blow ya horn now!

So we're shakin' back and forth, now;
Just keep it comin', babe...
Treat my body like a guitar - you got to, you got to keep on strummin'...

But in the back of my mind, (I wonder,)
Is it gonna be the last time?
Well, if it ain't about lovin', and you gon' keep it comin',
Well, baby, with me, that's fine...

(Is y'all alright?) I don't know, but I know what's happened to me, girl...
(Is y'all alright?) Uh... break it down now!
(Is y'all alright?) I don't know, but I know what's happened to me, girl...
(Is y'all alright?) Unh. Huh... break it down now!

See, you gotta work it out...
See, you gotta work it out... (Oh...)
Brotha gotta work it out...
Oh, ooh, whoa...

Chad, blow ya horn now! (Babe...)
C'mon, Chad, blow ya horn now!
Chad, blow ya horn now!
C'mon, Chad, blow ya horn now!

I like this!
Oh, ooh... hey...
Uh... lookie here! Ha! Bridge!

So, baby, hold me like you don't wanna let go;
I'm feelin' foxy, 'cause, boy, you're workin' it out...
Daddy, you've given me a taste of your honey - I want the whole beehive; (Whole beehive...)
I'm gonna call you my sugar, 'cause I've had the sweetest time...

See, you gotta work it out... (Uh...)
See, you gotta work it out... (Uh, uh...)
Brotha gotta work it out...
Ah-ooh-ooh... mmm, mmm...

I like it when the horn go...
I like it when the horn go... (Oh, oh, uh, unh...)
Like it when the horn go!
Like it when the horn go...

Ha! Austin better work it out...
