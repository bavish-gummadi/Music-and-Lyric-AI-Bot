How ya doin', honey, baby?
I know I don't ask for much
But for a girl spendin' time alone
Can be pretty rough

But I get a knock on my door
You know it's yours for sure
We can't wait for the bedroom
So we just hit the floor

Is y'all alright? I don't know
But I know what's happened to me, girl
Is y'all alright?
Break it down now

Is y'all alright? I don't know
But I know what's happened to me, girl
Is y'all alright?
Break it down now

She gotta work it out
He gotta work it out
She gotta work it out

So baby, hold me
Like you don't wanna let go
I'm feelin' foxy
Yeah, if you take it slow

My love you've given me a taste of your honey
I want the whole beehive
I'm gonna call you my sugar to fly high

You gotta work it out
You gotta work it out
Baby gotta work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out''''''''''''''''''
