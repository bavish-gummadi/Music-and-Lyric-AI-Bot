Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against a fence
I've been hit too hard, seen too much
Nothing can heal me now but your touch
I just don't know what I'm gonna do
I was alright 'til I fell in love with you

Well, my house is on fire, burnin' to the sky
Well, I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by
And I feel like I'm comin' to the end of my way
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray
Still, I don't know what I'm gonna do
I was alright 'til I fell in love with you

Boys in the street beginnin' to play
Girls like birds, flyin' away
When I'm gone you will remember my name
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and fame
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do
I was alright 'til I fell in love with you

Well, junk's pilin' up, takin' up space
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face
Sweat pourin' down, I'm starin' at the floor
I'm thinkin' about that girl who won't be back no more
I just don't know what to do
I was alright 'til I fell in love with you

Well, I'm tired of talkin', I'm tired of tryin' to explain
My attemps to please ya, they were all in vain
Tomorrow night before the sun goes down
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie bound
Still, I just don't know what I'm gonna do
I was alright 'til I fell in love with you''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
