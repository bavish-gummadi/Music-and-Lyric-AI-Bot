When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes, and said, "What else you got left?"
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget
Everybody must give something back for something they get"

I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come
And she buttoned her boot, and straightened her suit, and she said, "Don't get cute"
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum

She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked
And after finding out I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against

Her Jamaica rum, and when she did come, I asked her for some
She said, "No, dear," I said, "Your words aren't clear, you'd better spit out your gum"
She screamed 'til her face got so red, then she fell on the floor
And I covered up and then thought I'd go look through her drawer

And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you
And you, you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time
And I, I never took much, I never asked for your crutch
Now don't ask for mine''''''''''''''''''
