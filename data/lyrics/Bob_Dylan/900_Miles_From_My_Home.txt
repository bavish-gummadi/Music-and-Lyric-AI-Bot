But I'm down here on this track
Not a shirt upon my back
I will sell to you this island that I own
Yes I feed the mouths I took
But as down winds on the brook
Lord I'm 900 miles from my home

If my old lady she says so
I'll railroad no more
Sidetrack this engine but I still roam
Yes I've given it my coal
I've gladly given it all
'Cause I'm 900 miles from my home

If I get down by the bank And the river still does run
Yes and everything I see turns to foam
Even down on the ocean side
No she don't wade in just to bang my pride
'Cause I'm 900 miles from my home

Oh Mary don't you moan
Don't you weep on the ground Oh Mary don't you weep and don't you moan
If I get myself in line
I will be there in due time
'Cause I'm 900 miles from my home''''''''''''''''
