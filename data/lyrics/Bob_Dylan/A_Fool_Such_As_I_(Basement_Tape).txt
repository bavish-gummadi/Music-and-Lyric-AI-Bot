Pardon me if I'm sentimental, when we say goodbye
Don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you're gone, I will dream as years go by
Now and then there's a fool such as I

Now and then there's a fool, such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
I am a fool, but I love you dear, until the day I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I

Pardon me if I'm sentimental, when we say goodbye
Don't be angry with me, if I should cry
When you're gone, I dream a little dream as years go by
Now and then there's a fool such as I

Now and then there's a fool, such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
I'm a fool, but I love you dear, until the day I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I''''''''''''''''
