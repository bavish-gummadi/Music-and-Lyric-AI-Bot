As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden
Wounded flowers were danglin' from the vine
I was passin' by yon cool and crystal fountain
Someone hit me from behind

Ain't talkin', just walkin'
Through this weary world of woe
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
No one on Earth would ever know

They say prayer has the power to help, so pray for me, mother
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
I am tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others
But oh, mother, things ain't goin' well

Ain't talkin', just walkin'
I'll burn that bridge before you get across
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost

I'm all worn out from weepin'
My eyes are full of tears and my lips are dry
If I ever catch my opponents sleepin'
I'll slaughter 'em where they lie

Ain't talkin', just walkin'
Through a world mysterious and vague
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Walkin' through the cities of the plague

The whole world is filled with speculation
The whole world which people say is round
I've got no time for idle conversation
I need to find a doctor in this town

Ain't talkin', just walkin'
All rails leadin' to the West
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
I'm gonna throw myself upon your lovin' breast

It's the first new day of a grand and a glorious autumn
The queen of love is comin' across the grass
None dare call her anything but madam
No one flirts with her or even makes a pass

Ain't talkin', just walkin'
Standin' outside the gates of wrath
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Take a little trip down the primrose path

I got the worst old feeling and it's gettin' stronger
I'm worn out with public service, I'm beginnin' to crack
I won't stay on any longer
I'll avenge my father's death then I'll step back

Ain't talkin', just walkin'
Hand me down my walkin' cane
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Tryin' to get you out of my miserable brain

As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden
The wounded flowers were danglin' from the vine
I was passin' by yon cool and crystal fountain
Someone hit me from behind

Ain't talkin', just walkin'
You ride up high and down you go
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
No one on Earth will ever know''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
