Alberta let your hair hang low
Alberta let your hair hang low
I'll give you more gold
Than your apron strings can hold
If you'd only let your hair hang low.

Alberta what's on your mind
Alberta what's on your mind
You keep me worried and bothered
All of the time
Alberta what's on your mind.''''''''''''''''
