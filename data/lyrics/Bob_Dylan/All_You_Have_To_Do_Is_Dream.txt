If the farmer has no silo
And his fuel cost runs up high
Well, that's just how much I would love you
If you'd just only let me try.

In some nice young up to date kitchen
Let us get acquainted, dear
And them old floor birds will just quit eatin'
And just grin from ear to ear.

Two floor birds and a prudent baby chick
Yes that ain't, that ain't much to bust
But restriction causes damage
And damage causes lust.

So poor little girl, come blow this horn
Hard as any whole night seems
It's very easily done actually
All you have to do is dream.

Well, them old back scrapers are a dime a dozen
And I can get a call for a nickel
Yes, but look what an earful I get and it's all awful too
Every time I try to go get me a little tickle.

So, gimme one sweet loaf of bread
Just one sweet loaf, fill it up and I'll be gone
Yes, just like some of these old floor birds
Who fly from dawn to dawn.
Oh yes, who fly from dawn to dawn
Yes, who fly from dawn to dawn
Oh, fly from dawn to dawn.''''''''''''''''
