Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Back to New Orleans
You know it hurt me so
Baby please don't go.

Turn your lamp down low
Turn your lamp down low
Turn your lamp down low
Don't drive me from your door
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't leave. 

Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Back to New Orleans
You know it hurt me so
Baby please don't go.

Turn your lamp down low
Turn your lamp down low
Turn your lamp down low
Don't drive me from your door
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't leave
Baby please don't go.''''''''''''''''''''''''
