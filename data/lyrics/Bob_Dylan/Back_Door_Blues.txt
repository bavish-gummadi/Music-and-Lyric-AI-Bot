I'd rather see my coffin comin'
Comin' through my back door
I'd rather see my coffin
Comin' through my back door
I'd rather see my coffin comin'
Comin' through my back door
Than the girl I'm a-lovin'
She say she don't love me no more.

Can you see me leavin'
Babe, I sure left so far
Can you see me leavin'
I feel I sure left so far
Sometimes I'm a-wonderin'
Who you think you are.''''''''''''''''
