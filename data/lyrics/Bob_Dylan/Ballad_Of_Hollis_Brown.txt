Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down

You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile

Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe

The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?

You prayed to the Lord above, oh please send you a friend
You prayed to the Lord above, oh please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't a-got no friend

Your baby's a-cryin' louder now, it's a-poundin' on your brain
Your baby's a-cryin' louder now, it's a-poundin' on your brain
Your wife screams are stabbing you like the dirty driving rain

Your grass is turnin' black, there's no water in your well
Your grass is turnin' black, there's no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar on seven shotgun shells

Way out in the wilderness, a cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness, a cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on a shotgun that's hangin' on the wall

Your brain is a-bleedin' and your legs can't seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin' and your legs can't seem to stand
Your eyes fix on a shotgun that you're holdin' in your hand

There's seven breezes blowin' all around the cabin door
There's seven breezes blowin' all around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar

There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance there's seven new people born'''''''''''''''''
