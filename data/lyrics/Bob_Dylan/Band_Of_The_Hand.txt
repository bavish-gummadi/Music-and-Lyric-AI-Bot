(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)

Down these streets the fools rule
There's no freedom or self respect
A knife's point or a trip to the joint
Is about all you can expect

They kill people here who stand up for their rights
The system's just too damned corrupt
It's always the same, the name of the game
Is who do you know higher up
Well...

(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)

The blacks and the whites
The idiotic, the exotic
Wealth is a filthy rag
So erotic so unpatriotic
So wrapped up in the American flag

Witchcraft scum exploiting the dumb
Turning children into punks and slaves
Whose heroes and healers are rich dope dealers
Who should be put in their graves
Tell the truth now...

(It's Hell time, man)
Well, lookie here, honey
(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)

Listen to me Mr. Pussyman
This might be your last night in a bed so soft
We're not pimps on the make, politicians on the take
You can't pay us off

We're gonna blow up your home of Voodoo
And watch it burn without any regret
We got the power we're the new government
You just don't know it yet
Help me now...

(It's Hell time, man)
Ah, bring it to me honey
(It's Hell time, man)

For all of my brothers from Vietnam
And my uncles from World War II
I'd like to say that it's countdown time now
And we're gonna do what the law should do

And for you pretty baby
I know you've seen it all
I know your story is too painful to share
One day though you'll be talking in your sleep
And when you do, I wanna be there
Yeah...

(It's Hell time, man)
Be strong, baby
(It's Hell time, man)
Won't take long, baby
(Band of the hand)
Ah, let me tell you now
(It's Hell time, man)
The war is here, honey
(Band of the hand)
Ah, go ahead now
(It's Hell time, man)
Be strong, baby
(Band of the hand)
It won't be long, honey
(It's Hell time, man)
Be strong, baby''''''''''''''''''
