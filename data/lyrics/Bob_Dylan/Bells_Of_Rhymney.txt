Oh what will you give me?
Say the sad bells of Rhymney.
Is there hope for the future?
Say the brown bells of Merthyr.
Who made the mine owner?
Say the black bells of Rhondda.
And who robbed the miner?
Say the big bells of Blaina.

They will plunder willy-nilly
Say the bells of Caerphilly
They have fangs, they have teeth
Shout the loud bells of Neath
Even God is uneasy
Say the moist bells of Swansea
And what will you give me?
Say the bad bells of Rhymney.

Throw the vandals in court
Say the bells of Newport.
All would be well, if, if, if, if
Say the green bells of Cardiff.
Why so worried, sister, why?
Say the silver bells of Wye.
And what will you give me?
Say the bad bells of Rhymney.''''''''''''''''
