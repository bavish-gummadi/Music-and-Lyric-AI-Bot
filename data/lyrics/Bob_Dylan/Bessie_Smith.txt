Bessie was more than just a friend of mine
We shared the good times with the bad
Now many a year has passed me by
I still recall the best thing I ever had

Now I'm goin' down the road to see Bessie
Oh, see her soon
I'm just goin' down the road to see Bessie Smith
When I get there, I'm wonderin' what she'll do

All the crazy things I had to try
Well, I tried them all and then some
But if you're lucky, one day you find out
Where it is you're really comin' from

Now I'm goin' down the road to see Bessie
Oh, see her soon
I'm just goin' down the road to see Bessie Smith
When I get there, I'm wonderin' what she'll do

Now, in my day, I've made some foolish moves
But back then, I didn't worry about a thing
Now and again, I still wonder to myself
Was it her sweet love or the way that she could sing?

So I'm goin' down the road to see Bessie
Ooh, see her soon
I'm just goin' down the road to see Bessie Smith
And when I get there, I'm wonderin' what she'll do''''''''''''''''''
