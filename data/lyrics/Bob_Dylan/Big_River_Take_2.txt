Well I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry.
I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
But the tears that I shed for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die.

Well I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota.
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.
And I heard that my dream was Downstream cavortin' in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River, when you called.

Well you took me on down to St. Louis later on, down the river.
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
Well I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.
She raised a few eyebrows and then she walked down alone.

Why won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it down.
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Let her go I've had enough dump the blues down in the Gulf
It's she loves you Big River, ma, it ain't me''''''''''''''''
