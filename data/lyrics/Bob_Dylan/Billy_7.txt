Spend the night with some sweet seorita
Into her dark hallway she will lead you
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home

They say that Pat Garrett's got your number
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber
Every little sound just might be thunder
Thunder from the barrel of his gun

Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow
Spending the time that you borrow
Figuring a way to get back home''''''''''''''''''
