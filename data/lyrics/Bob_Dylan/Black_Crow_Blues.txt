I woke in the mornin' wandering, weary and worn out
I woke in the mornin' wandering, weary and worn out
Wishin' my long-lost lover would walk to me and talk to me
Tell me what it's all about

I was standin' at the side road, listenin' to the billboard knock
Standin' at the side road, listenin' to the billboard knock
Well, my wrist was empty but my nerves were kickin'
Tickin' like a clock

If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime
Anytime you want

Sometimes I'm thinkin' I'm too high to fall
Sometimes I'm thinkin' I'm much too high to fall
Other times I'm thinkin' I'm so low I don't know
If I can come up at all

Black crows in the meadow, sleepin' across the broad highway
Black crows in the meadow across the broad highway
Though it's funny, honey, I'm out of touch
Don't feel much like a scarecrow today''''''''''''''''''
