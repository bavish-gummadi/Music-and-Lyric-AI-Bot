While riding on a train goin' west
I fell asleep for to take my rest
I dreamed a dream that made me sad
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had

With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Where my friends and I had spent many an afternoon
Where we together weathered many a storm
Laughin' and singin' 'til the early hours of the morn'

By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung
Our words was told, our songs was sung
Where we longed for nothin' and were satisfied
Jokin' and talkin' about the world outside

With hungry hearts through the heat and cold
We never much thought we could get very old
We thought we could sit forever in fun
Our chances really was a million to one

As easy it was to tell black from white
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split

Now many a year has passed and gone
Many a gamble has been lost and won
And many a road taken by many a first friend
And each one I've never seen again

I wish, I wish, I wish in vain
That we could sit simply in that room again
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
