Well, the bonnie ship was a good old ship
She was a-fishin' on a leading chain
And me an' John, oh was a long catch on
It was the last of the ones I've seen.

So with a sword and a rope in belt
Feel all that your heart be sailed
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales.

Well, we feud all night, the cabin gauge,
It was a-more than feelin' bad
And with all kind friends we watched in fear
It was a naught time we ever had.

So it's rise up my lads
Let your hearts never fail
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales.

And all day long at Vera Cruz
We sailed [all the likes] to bind
With no heavy moan, any hearts of stone
No aid was tried for mine.

So it's cheer up my boys
Let your hearts never fail
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales.

Well, now along cape Fate, 'twas lit in red
All along cape Horn
And from Vera Cruz we sailed ahead
It was all in the time of storm.

So, it's cheer on up my boys
Let your hearts never fail
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales.''''''''''''''''
