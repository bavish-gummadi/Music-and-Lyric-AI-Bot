In the lonely night
In the stardust of a pale blue light
I think of you in black and white
When we were made of dreams.

I walk alone through the shakin' street
Listenin' my heart beat
In the record breakin' heat
Where we were born in time.

Just when I thought
You were gone, you came back
Just when I was ready
To receive you.

You were smooth, you were rough
You were more than enough
Oh babe, why did I ever leave you?
Or grieve you?

On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve
I took you close and got what I deserved
Where we were born in time.

Just when I knew
Who to thank, you went blank
Just when the firelight
Was gleaming

You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, you were plain
Oh babe, could it be that you been scheming?
Or was I dreaming?

In the hills of mystery
In the foggy web of destiny
You're still so deep inside of me
When we were born in time.''''''''''''''''''
