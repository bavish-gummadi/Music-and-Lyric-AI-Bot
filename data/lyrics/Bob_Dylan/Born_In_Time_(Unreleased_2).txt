In the lonely night
In the smoking stardust of a pale blue light
You're standing there in black and white
When we were made of dreams.

I walk alone through the shaky streets
Listenin' my heart beat
In the record breakin' heat
Where we were born in time.

Just when I thought
You were gone, you came back
Just when I knew
It was for certain.

You were high, you were low
You were so easy to know
Oh babe, now it's time to raise the curtain
I'm hurtin'.

Up on the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve
Took me in and got what I deserved
Where we were born in time.

Just when I knew
Who to thank, you went blank
Just when the home-fires
Start smoking.

You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, you were plain
Oh babe, truer words have not been spoken
Or broken.

In the hills of mystery
In the foggy web of destiny
You're still so deep inside of me
Where we were born in time.''''''''''''''''''
