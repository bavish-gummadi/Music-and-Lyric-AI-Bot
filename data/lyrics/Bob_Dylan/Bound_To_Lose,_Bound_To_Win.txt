Well, I'm bound to lose, bound to win
Bound to walk to the road again
Bound to lose, bound to win
Bound for a-walkin' the road again

Well, I'm just one of them ramblin' men
Ramblin' since I don't know when
Here I come and I'm-a gone again
You might think I got no end

Bound to lose, I'm bound to win
I'm bound for a-walkin' the road again
Bound to lose, I'm bound to win
Bound for a-walkin' the road again''''''''''''''''
