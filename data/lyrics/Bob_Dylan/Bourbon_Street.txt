I'd like another Bourbon Street
(??) Oh so sweet
Hold that down, you better keep it neat
For when it's over, it was incomplete
Oh, I took it down and said, oh, oh have a seat
But I don't live down on Bourbon Street
No more, no more, no more, no more
No, I don't live on Bourbon Street no more.

Bourbon Street lordy-town
You better keep it sweet
Put all your loving apples on your feet
But I don't even mind if you want to scratch your feet
You can bag it down in butter, butter sweet
Now don't (??) on my Bourbon Street.

Now, Bourbon Street
A happiness will get you, Bourbon Street
The girls they won't forget you down at Bourbon Street.
Here they come now
Here they come now
Here they come now
Oh them little girls

Well, I went down a-looking for Bourbon Street
I look a-high and low and then it took me off my feet
Bourbon Street
Oh man, let me tell ya, Bourbon Street
Mister bartender, I'll have another Bourbon Street

Oh play it pretty now, boys!
Ah, sounds marvelous
Oh, shit
Yes, yes
Yes a ton of joy

Oh, I can't take it no more

Well let me tell ya, Bourbon Street
Let me have another Bourbon Street
Tell me young brother I want a Bourbon Street
I want a Bourbon Street now
Mister bartender, I'll have...
I'll have another Bourbon Street''''''''''''''''
