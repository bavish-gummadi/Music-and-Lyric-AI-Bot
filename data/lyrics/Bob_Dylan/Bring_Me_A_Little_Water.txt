Sylvie is a good old girl, from Florida so they say
She came up here last April to pass some time away

Now won't you bring me a little water, Sylvie?
Bring me a little water now?
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?
For my tired brow

Sylvie came here Wednesday,
She came this morning by the light of the dawn
She comes up here now nearly all of the time
To see if she can carry on

Now won't you bring me a little water, Sylvie?
Bring me a little water now?
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?
For my tired brow

Sylvie says she loves me,
She says it all of the time
She always gets behind me,
When the hill is too high to climb

Now bring me a little water, Sylvie?
Bring me a little water now?
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?
For my tired brow

She brings beer and honey,
Brings me slop and beans
Brings me coconuts and candy,
Brings me turnip greens

Bring me a little water, Sylvie?
Bring me a little water now?
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?
For my tired brow
For my tired brow
Oh, for my tired brow''''''''''''''''
