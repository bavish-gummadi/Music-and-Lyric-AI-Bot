I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind
I can't wait, waitin' just makin' me go blind
Do you ever lay awake at night your face turned to the wall
Drownin' in your thoughtlessness and cut off from it all
I don't know, maybe to you it's not that late
But as for me don't know how much longer I can wait.

It's got to end, everything about it just feels wrong
I pretend, being close to her is where I don't belong
Well my back is to the sun because the light is too intense
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
I'll stay here where I can feel the hand of fate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.

Skies are grey, life is short and I think of her a lot
I can't say if I want the pain to end or not
Well the blindness overtakin' me is beatin' like a drum
I don't know where it starts or where it's coming from
How it is, we'll all try to concentrate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.

I been drinkin'
Drinkin' forbidden juices
I been livin'
Livin' on lame excuses.

My hands are cold, the end of time has just begun
I'm getting old, anything can happen now to anyone
I walk across the floor 'til I wear out my shoes
You think you've lost it all there's always more to lose
I'm so clear, she can keep my head on straight
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
