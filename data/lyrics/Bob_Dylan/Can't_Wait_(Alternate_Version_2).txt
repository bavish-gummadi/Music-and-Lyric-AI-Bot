I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind
I can't wait for you to walk the line
You ever feel just like your brain been bolted to the wall
That you're drowning in your thoughtlessness and cut off from it all
I don't know, maybe for you it's not that late
But as for me I don't know how much longer I can wait.

It's got to end, everything about it just feels wrong
I'll pretend being close to her is where I don't belong
Well my back is to the sun because the light is too intense
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
That's how it is when things disintegrate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.

Skies are grey, life is short and I think of her a lot
Every day I can't say whether I want the pain to even end or not
Well I'm trying my best to stand on my own two feet
Not have to lean on everybody that I meet
I'm breathing hard, I'm trying to concentrate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.

I'm torn and I'm tattered
I been rolling through the stormy weather
My heart's been shattered
But I'm holding all the parts of it together.

My hands are cold, the end of time has just begun
I'm getting old, anything can happen now to anyone
Loneliness around me digging in me like a rake
What a piece of work she is to cause my heart to break
I thought somehow that I'd be spared this fate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
