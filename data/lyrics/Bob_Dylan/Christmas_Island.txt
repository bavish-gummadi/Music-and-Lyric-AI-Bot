How'd you like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd you like to spend a holiday a way across the sea?
How'd you like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd you like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree?

How'd you like to stay up late like the islanders do
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe?
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island
You will never stray for every day your Christmas dreams come true''''''''''''''''''
