Get you a copper kettle
Get you a copper coil
Fill it with new made corn mash
And never more you'll toil

You'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-filling
In the pale moonlight

Build you a fire with hickory
Hickory, ash, and oak
Don't use no green or rotten wood
It'll get you by the smoke

We'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-filling
In the pale moonlight

My daddy, he made whiskey
My granddaddy, he did too
We ain't paid no whiskey tax
Since 1792

We'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-filling
In the pale moonlight''''''''''''''''
