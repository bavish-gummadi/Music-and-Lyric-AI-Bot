Well, I had to go down to see a guy named
Mr. Goldsmith
Nasty, dirty, double-crossin', back-stabbin' phony
I didn't want to have to deal with

But I did it for you
And all you gave me was a smile
Well, I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry a while

I don't carry dead weight
I'm no flash in the pan
All right, I'll set you straight
Can't you see I'm a union man

I'm lettin' the cat out of the cage
I'm keepin' a low profile
Well, I cried for you
Now it's your turn, you can cry a while

Feel like a fightin' rooster
Feel better than I ever felt
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess
And the Denver road is a-goin' to melt

I went to the church house
Every day I go an extra mile
Well, I cried for you
Now your turn, you can cry a while

Last night, 'cross the alley
There was a poundin' on the wall
It must have been Don Pasquale
Makin' a 2 a.m. booty call

To break a trusting heart like mine
Was just your style
Well, I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry a while

I'm on the fringes of the night
Fighting back my tears that I can't control
Some people they ain't human
They got no heart or soul

But I'm a-cryin' to the Lord
Tryin' to be meek and mild
Yes, I've cried for you
Now it's your turn, you can cry a while

Well the preacher's in the pulpit
And the babies in their cribs
I'm longin' for that sweet fat
That sticks to your ribs

I'm goin' to buy me a barrel of whisky
I'll die before I turn senile
Yes, I've cried for you
Now it's your turn, you can cry a while

Well, you bet on the horses
And they ran the wrong way
I always said you'd be sorry
And today could be the day

I might need a good lawyer
Could be your funeral, my trial
Well, I cried for you
Now it's your turn, you can cry a while''''''''''''''''''''
