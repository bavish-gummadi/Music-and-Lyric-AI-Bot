Day in, day out
The same old voodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And darling, I think of you, day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my day begin
When I awake I awake with a tingle, one possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums

But can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in and day out

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss those lips and the pounding becomes
Large ocean roar, nine thousand drums

Can't you see that it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
And here it is
When there it is
Day in and day out''''''''''''''''''''
