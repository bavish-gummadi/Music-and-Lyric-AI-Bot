Dear Mrs.Roosevelt, don't hang your head and cry
His mortal flesh is laid away but his good work fills the sky
This world was lucky to see him born

Now he went up to grade school and he wrote back to his folks
He drew such funny pictures and was always pulling jokes
This world was lucky to see him born

He went up to Harvard to read his books of law
He loved his trees and horses, he loved everything he saw
This world was lucky to see him born

He got struck down by the fever and it settled in his leg
He loved the folks that wished him well and everybody did
This world was lucky to see him born

He took office on a crippled leg and he said to one and all
"Your money changing racket, boys, sure enough got to fall."
This world was lucky to see him born

I voted for him lots of times and I'd vote for him again
He tried to find an honest job for every idle man
This world was lucky to see him born

He helped me to build my union and he learned me how to talk
I could see he was a cripple but he learned my soul to talk
This world was lucky to see him born

I was a GI in the army the day he passed away
And over my shoulder I could hear some soldier say
"This world was lucky to see him born."

I know this world was lucky just to see him born
I know this world was lucky just to see him born
This world was lucky to see him born''''''''''''''''''''
