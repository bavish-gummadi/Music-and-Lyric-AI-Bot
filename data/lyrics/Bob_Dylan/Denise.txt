Denise, Denise
Gal, what's on your mind
Denise, Denise
Gal, what's on your mind
You got your eyes closed
Heaven knows that you ain't blind.

Well, I can see you smilin'
But oh your mouth is inside out
Well, I can see you smilin'
But oh your mouth is inside out
Well, I know that you're laughin'
But what are you laughin' about.

Well, if you're tryin' to throw me
Babe, I've already been tossed
If you're tryin' to throw me
Babe, I've already been tossed
Babe, you're tryin' to lose me
Babe, I'm already lost.

Well, what are you doin'
Are you flyin' or have you flipped?
Oh, what are you doin'
Are you flyin' or have you flipped?
Well, you call my name
An' then say your tongue just slipped.

Denise, Denise
You're concealed here on the shelf
Denise, Denise
You're concealed here on the shelf
I'm lookin' deep in you eyes, babe
An' all I can see is myself.''''''''''''''''
