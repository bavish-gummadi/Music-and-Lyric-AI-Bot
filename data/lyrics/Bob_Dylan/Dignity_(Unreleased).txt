Fat man lookin' in a ferris wheel
Yellow man lookin' in his last meal
Hollow man lookin' in a cotton field
For dignity

Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass
Young man lookin' in the days that pass
Poor man lookin' through painted glass
For dignity

Dignity is a woman that knows
Dignity moves like a tropical wind that blows
Into the cities, into the towns
Into the land of the midnight sun

I'm searching high, I'm searching low
Searchin' everywhere I know
Askin' the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?

Drunk man listens to a voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors
Looking into the lost, forgotten years
For dignity

Don Juan was talkin' to Don Miguel
Standing outside of the gates of hell
There ain't nothing to say, it ain't nothing to tell
'Bout dignity

Dignity is a woman unspoiled
By fame and greed and snakes that are coiled
In the damp woods, on the river's edge
Near the green, green grass of home

Pull into the platform, step off the train
Walk thirty steps, it begins to rain
I'm askin' somebody with water on his brain
Have you seen dignity?

Cities in a mess of jackhammer beats
Buses roll by with burned out seats
A child's eyes look through the creeping streets
For dignity

Prince Phillip was talkin' to Miss Mary Lou
She said don't let nobody see me talking to you
She's afraid to tell him what she knew
About dignity

Dignity is a woman that's light
She don't tease, she don't travel at night
Dignity is a woman that bleeds
Like the hot Egyptian sun

I'm lookin' East, lookin' West
See people cursed, see people blessed
Askin' everybody like a man possessed
Have you seen dignity?

Blind man breakin' out of a trance
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Hopin' to find one circumstance
Of dignity

Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity

Somebody showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
Dignity got no startin' point
No beginnin', no middle, no end

Looking at a glass that's half-filled
Looking at a dream that's just been killed
Askin' everybody that's strong-willed
Have you seen dignity?''''''''''''''''
