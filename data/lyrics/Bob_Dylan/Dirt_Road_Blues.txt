Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide

Well, I been pacing around the room hoping maybe she'd come back 
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one room country shack

Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed

But I been lookin' at my shadow, I been watching the colors up above
Lookin' at my shadow, watching the colors up above
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love

Gon' walk on down that dirt road till everything becomes the same
Gon' walk on down that dirt road till everything becomes the same
Gotta keep on walkin' till I hear her holler out my name''''''''''''''''''''
