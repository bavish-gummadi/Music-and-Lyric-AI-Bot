Lots of folks back east they say
"Hello" every day,
Hitting the hard old dusty way to the California line
Across that desert sand they go
They're getting out of the old dust bowl
They think they're going to a sugar bowl
But here is what they find
Oh the police at the port of entry say,
"You're number fourteen thousand for today"

And, well if you ain't got the do re mi, boy
If you ain't got the do re mi
Better go on back to beautiful Texas,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee.
California is the garden of eden
A paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not
You won't find it so hot
If you ain't got the do re mi.

If you want a house or farm
That won't do nobody harm
Take your vacation by the mountains or the sea.
Don't swap that old cow for a car
Better stay right where you are
You had better take this tip from me.
'Cause I read it in the want ads every day
And the headlines on the papers always say

If you ain't got the do re mi, boy
If you ain't got the do re mi
Better go on back to beautiful Texas,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee.
California is a garden of eden
A paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not
You won't find it so hot
If you ain't got the do re mi.''''''''''''''''
