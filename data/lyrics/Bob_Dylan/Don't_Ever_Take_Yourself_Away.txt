Don't ever take yourself away
Don't ever take yourself
To a place where I can't find you
Don't ever take yourself away

I will never leave you
Will never deceive you
I'll be right there walkin' behind you

Dearest, I think you're the one
I can't imagine anybody doin'
More to me than you do

Dearest, if it's your heart that I won
There's no need for blame
And no reason to be ashamed
Of that place where we stand in the sun

Don't ever take yourself away
Don't ever take yourself
To a place where I can't find you
Don't ever take yourself away

I will never leave you
I will never deceive you
I'll be right there walkin' behind you

Dearest, let us not drift apart
It wouldn't be wise
It wouldn't be civilized
It wouldn't be smart

Time heals a broken heart
You've been hurt
You've been left in the dirt
But you still look brand new to me

Don't ever take yourself away
Don't ever take yourself
To a place where I can't find you
Don't ever take yourself away

I will never leave you
I will never deceive you
I'll be right there walkin' behind you

Dearest, you're the answer to my prayers
Words can't express
If my heart would confess
What you mean to me

Dearest, I can't help knowin' that you're the best
I don't have to feel you to know that you're real
You're more than a dream to me

Don't ever take yourself away
Don't ever take yourself
To a place where I can't find you
Don't ever take yourself away

I will never leave you
I will never deceive you
I'll be right there walking behind you'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
