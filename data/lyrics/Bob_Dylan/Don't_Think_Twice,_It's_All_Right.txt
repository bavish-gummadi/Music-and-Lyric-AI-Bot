Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow

When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm a-travellin' on
But don't think twice, it's all right

And it ain't no use in a-turnin' on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road

But I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talkin' anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right

So it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
I can't hear you anymore

I'm a-thinkin' and a-wonderin', walkin' down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I am told
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

So long, honey babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
And goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say fare thee well

I ain't a-sayin' you treated me unkind
You coulda done better, but I don't mind
You just kind of wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
