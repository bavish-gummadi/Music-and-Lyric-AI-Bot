Down along the cove, I spied my true love comin' my way
Down along the cove, I spied my true love comin' my way
I said, "Lord have mercy, mama
It sure is good to see you comin' today"

Down along the cove, I spied my little bundle of joy
Down along the cove, I spied my little bundle of joy
She said, "Lord have mercy, honey
I'm so glad you're my boy"

Down along the cove, we walked together hand in hand
Down along the cove, we walked together hand in hand
Everybody watchin' us go by
Knows we're in love, yes, they understand''''''''''''''''''
