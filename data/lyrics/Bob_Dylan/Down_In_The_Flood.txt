Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint
But oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

Now, don't you try an' move me, you're just gonna lose
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you've been refused
Well, it's sugar for sugar and salt for salt
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

Well, that high tide's risin', mama, don't you let me down
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Yes, you're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow'''''''''''''''''
