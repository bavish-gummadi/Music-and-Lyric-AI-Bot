The light in this place is really bad
Like bein' in the bottom of a stream
Any minute now
I'm expecting to wake up from a dream

Means so much the softest touch
By the grave of some child
Who neither wept nor smiled
I've pondered my faith in the rain

I been dreamin' of you that's all I do
And it's drivin' me insane

Somewhere dawn is breakin'
Light is streakin' 'cross the floor
Church bells are ringin'
I wonder who they're ringin' for

Travel under any star
You'll see me wherever you are
The shadowy past is so vague and so vast
I'm sleepin' in the balance of pain

I been dreamin' of you that's all I do
But it's drivin' me insane

Maybe they'll get me, maybe they won't
But whatever it won't be tonight
I wish your hand was in mine right now
We could go where the moon is white

For years they had me locked in a cage
Then they threw me onto the stage
Some things just last longer than you thought they would
And they're never ever explained

I'm dreamin' of you that's all I do
And it's driving me insane

Well I eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry
Live my life on the square
Even if the flesh falls off my face
It won't matter, long as you're there

Feel like a ghost in love
Underneath the heavens above
Feel further away than I ever did before
Feel further than I can take

Dreamin' of you, that's all I do
But it's driving me insane

Everything in the way is so shiny today
A queer and unusual form
Spirals of golden haze here and there in a blaze
Like beams of light in a storm

Maybe you're here or maybe you weren't
Maybe you touched somebody and got burned
The silent sun has got me on the run
Burnin' a hole in my brain

I'm dreamin' of you that's all I do
But it's driving me insane''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
