Well it's twinkle, twinkle, little star
'Long come Brady in his lectric' car
Well he's got a mean look right in his eye
He gonna shoot somebody just to see him die
He been on the job too long.

Well, Duncan, Duncan was attendin' the bar
'Long come Brady with his shiny star
"Well, Brady," said Duncan, "you are under arrest."
And Duncan shot a hole right in Brady's chest
He been on the job too long.

"Well, Brady, Brady, you know you done wrong
Breakin' in here while my game's goin' on
Breakin' down the window, bustin' down the door
Now you're lyin' dead on the barroom floor
You been on the job too long".

Well, old king Brady was a big fat man
Doctor looked down, and grabbed hold of his hand
Reached for his pulse, the doctor he said
"I believe to my soul, king Brady's dead."
He been on the job too long.

Well them rubber-tired carriage, standing around
Taking Brady to the burying ground
High-tired carriages, rubber-tired hack
Well they took him to the graveyard but they didn't bring him back
Well he been on the job too long

When the women all heard King Brady was dead,
Well they go home and they'd were raggin' red
Slippin' and a-slidin', shufflin' down the street,
In their big mother hubbards and their stockin' feet.
He been on the job too long.

Well Brady, Brady, Brady, you know you done wrong
Breakin' in here while my game's goin' on
Bustin' down the window, knockin' down the door
Now you're lyin' dead on the barroom floor
You been on the job too long.''&''&''&''&''&''&''&''&
