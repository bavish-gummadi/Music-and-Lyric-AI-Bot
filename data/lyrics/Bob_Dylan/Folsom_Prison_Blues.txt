I hear that train a-coming, it's coming round the bend
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
But I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, time keeps dragging on
And that train keeps on rolling down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mamma told me; "Son,
Always be a good boy, don't fool around with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eating in fancy dining cars
I bet they're drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-moving, and that's what torture me

Well if they'd free me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
You bet I moved it on down, a little further down the line
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I wanna stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away''''''''''''''''
