You know there's two old maids layin' in the bed
One picked up an' the other one she said
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off-a me.

Well, you know there late one night up on Blueberry Hill
One man turned to the other man an' said with a blood curdlin' chill, he said
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off-a me.

Well, you know we was layin' down around Mink Muscle Creek
One man said to the other man he began to speak, he said
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off-a me.

Well, you know we was cruisin' down the highway in a Greyhound bus
All kinds of little children on the sideroad they was hollerin' at us, sayin'
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off-a me.''''''''''''''''
