God knows I need you
God knows I do
God knows there ain't anybody
Ever gonna take the place of you

God knows I can take it
God knows I care
God knows that everybody got to have
Someone in the world somewhere

God knows there's an answer
God knows it's all in place
God knows it might be workin' right now
Look into this right straight in the face

Ain't no rhyme or reason
I know it can't be wrong
It was supposed to last a season
But it was so strong for so long

God knows I'm ready
God knows it's hard to find
God knows you're standin' right there before my very eyes
Messing up my mind

Ain't no rhyme or reason
I know it can't be wrong
It was supposed to last a season
But it's been so strong, ah, for so long

God knows there's a purpose
God knows there's a chance
God knows we can rise above the darkest hour
Under any circumstance''''''''''''''''
