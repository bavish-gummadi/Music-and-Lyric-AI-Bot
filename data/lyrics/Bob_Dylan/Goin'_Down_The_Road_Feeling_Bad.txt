I'm blowin' down that old dusty road
Yes I'm blowin' down that old dusty road
I'm blowin' down that old dusty road, lord, lord
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way.

It takes a ten dollar shoe on my feet
I get a ten dollar shoe on my feet
I get a ten dollar shoe on my feet, lord, lord
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way.

I'm goin' where the water taste like wine
I'm goin' where the water taste like wine
I'm goin' where the water taste like wine
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way.

I'm goin' down this road feeling bad
I'm goin' down this road feeling bad
I'm goin' down this road feeling bad, lord, lord
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way.

I'm goin' where the chilling wind don't blow
I'm goin' where the chilling wind don't blow
I'm goin' where the chilling wind don't blow
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way.

I'm goin' down this road feeling bad
I'm goin' down this road feeling bad
I'm goin' down this road feeling bad, lord, lord
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way
No I ain't gonna be treated this a-way.''''''''''''''''''''''''
