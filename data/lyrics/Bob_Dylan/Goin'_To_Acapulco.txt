I'm goin' down to Rosemary's
She never does me wrong
She puts it to me plain as day
And gives it to me for a song.
It's a wicked life but what the hell
Everybody's got to eat
And I'm just the same as anyone else
When it comes to scratchin' for my meat.

Goin' to Acapulco
Goin' on the run
Goin' down to see soccer
Goin' to have some fun
Yeah! Goin' to have some fun.

Now whenever I am gettin' up
And can't find what I need
I just make it down to Rosemary's
And get somethin' quick to eat.
It's not a bad way to make a livin'
And I ain't complainin' none
For I can plow my plum and drink my rum
And then go on home and have my fun.

Goin' to Acapulco
Goin' on the run
Goin' down to see soccer
Goin' to have some fun
Yeah! Goin' to have some fun.

Now when someone offers me a joke
I just say, "No thanks."
I try to tell them like it is
And keep away from pranks.
Like every time you know when the well breaks down
I just go pump on it some
Rosemary, she likes to go to big places
And just sit there waitin' for me to come.

Goin' to Acapulco
Goin' on the run
Goin' down to see soccer
Gonna have some fun
Yeah! Goin' to have some fun.''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
