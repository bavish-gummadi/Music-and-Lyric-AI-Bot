Well you know I'm lying 
But don't look at me with scorn.
Well you know I'm lying 
But don't look at me with scorn.
I'm going back to Rome
That's where I was born.

Buy me a ?? I can carry
Keep it for my friends.
Buy me a ?? I can carry
Keep it for my friends.
Don't go to Italy
All around the bend.

You can keep Madison Square Garden
Give me the Coliseum.
You can keep Madison Square Garden
Give me the Coliseum.
So I can see the ?? here
Man I can always see him.''''''''''''''''
