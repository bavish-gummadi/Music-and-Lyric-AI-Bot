Just the two of us (Baby your dada loves you) (Hey)
Just the two of us
Just the two of us (And I'mma always be here for you) (Hey)
Just the two of us (No matter what happens)

Just the two of us (You're all I got in this world) 
Just the two of us (I would never give you up for nothin'
Just the two of us (Nobody in this world)
Just the two of us (Is ever gonna keep you from me, I love you)

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (Whew), dada must've runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you want to help dada build a sand castle? (Yeah)
And mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin dinner while you were sweepin' and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)

See honey, there's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And dada's probably on his way to all of them except one
'Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real, real bad
She was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (Wah)
I told you it's okay Hai Hai, wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nana-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)

Wake up, sweepy head, we're here
Before we pway, we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screaming in her ear (Mama?)
That's why you can't get her to wake
But don't worry, dada made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yeah)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee
There goes mama, spwashin' in the water
No more fighting with dad, no more restraining order
No more step-dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you wuv her (Mommy?)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)

Just the two of us (Just me and you baby)
Just the two of us (Is all we need in this world)
Just the two of us (Just me and you)
Just the two of us

Your dada will always be there for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me I'mma always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you
I love you baby'''&'''&'''&'''&'''&'''&'''&'''&'''&
