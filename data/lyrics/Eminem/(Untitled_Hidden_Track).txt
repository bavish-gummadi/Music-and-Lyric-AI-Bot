Nah man
Not quite finished yet

Girl I think,
You just might'a tried to pull a muh'fucking fast one, I'm mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling, and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade? Tryna play games?
See this saw blade? See the silhouette of a stalker
In your walk-way? Better co-operate

Or get saute'd and rotisseried while you're hog-tied
M-C's get so quiet you can hear a muh'fucking dog whistle while I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fucking Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
Because in the movie Gremlins you can't feed them after midnight
Vrinn-vrinn! Motor's so big you can fit a midget in his engine

Bitch, give me them digits while you're cringin'
Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
While I spin spin even ten cents on you, since when
Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny, shit
If I think a penny's pretty just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie meenie miney mo, catch an Eskimo by his toe
While he's trying to roll a snowball but,
Don't make him lose his cool if he hollers better let him go y'all

Now here we go go go
Get up, baby get a move on
Like a U-Haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
You will never think of this shit
Yeah, honey you called?
Well here I come, Havoc on the beat, I reek it
Evil I see, hear and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady
Fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every muh'fucking chicken fore' it hatches

Cause, you can bet your ass that we gone get it crackin'
Like a Kraken and Titans when they're clashin'
Get your brains bashed in so bad
You gone have Kurt Kobain askin'
To autograph a bloodstained napkin
I'm fashionable and 'bout as rational
As a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line, run it up the flag pole with Elton
See if he's cool with it

Don't stand there and look stupid at me bitch
I ain't in the mood for this shit
Get my dick, Google it till it pops up
Y'all are so motherfucking full of shit that you're stopped up
Me I'm always shitting diarrhea of the mouth
Till your speakers crap out, "Ohp, What?"
Girl you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette "Chik-Chigarette"
But you won't get a hot fudge Sundae from me
So do not strut my way, slut! Because

Here we go go go

And now that I got your panties in a bunch
And your bowels in an uproar
I'm a show you why I Kang Xi
Stop asking me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore know you want more,
Bitches tell I put the Mat back into Mathers
'Cause I'm a fucking problem, Run boy!
Every flow got it mstered
So every last word that you fucking fags heard
Comes straight from the fishes ass, Yeah
In other words I'm a Bass turd!

Looking at me like I killed Kenny
Gassing the tank near steal plenty
No morals are instilled in me
So remorse I really don't feel any
Eat your heart out, Hannibal
Understandable why you're jealous, fucking animal
I got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now, can ya hoe?
Shady, I don't understand your flow.
Understand my flow?

Bitch I flow like Troy Palumalu's hair, boy.
Don't you dare try to follow or compare, boy.
I'm raw, you ain't even medium rare
Stay the fuck outta my hair, boy!
You can look, you can stare and point
But you can't touch since you're queer boy.
I don't get it man, is there a void
All this weak shit, what am I steroids?
Well bitch I'm back with some shit for that ass
And your trunk, Elephant hemorrhoids

And remember boys
Here we go go go

Thank you for coming out
Hope you enjoyed the show
Till next time
Ha ha
Peace''''''''''''''''
