(Shabaam Shadeeq)
Of course I rap till I'm hoarse
Add the sauce to them dry turkey MC's
Say what you like, I toss
In theory when you hear me
Like the guts of the Dutch
Snap caught you in the act like Vivitar
AF 2-5-5 auto-focus clear vision
Precision mics for people of all types
Call the cavalry
My brutality switch the pitch gradually
Aqua turntable knocka
Fresh like binocca
Jot the thoughts in my chronicles
Remarkable styles Shadeeq taxed it
Make an exit to spark mine
Nuclear physics with cannibals and phat rhymes
They know the time like it's a sundial, X-File

(Eminem)
Went to bible class with a gun
Blasted a nun
Fuck hell, Satan sent my ass to the sun
I wasn't born I was hatched
And dumped in the trash
With a note attached saying
Someone please whip this brat's ass
I never gave a rat's ass or a flying fuck
Driving drunk in a fire truck with the siren stuck
Slammin' the brakes
Skiddin out 'cause the tires suck,
Went to pull you off my dick
And got the pliers stuck
You better run 'cause I'm probably the only one
Crazy enough to shoot your ass with a knife
And stab you with a gun
I like fire, you might see me start it
I'm slightly retarded
I miss my sanity since the night we departed

(Skam)
Oldworlddisorder on some outnumbered shit
We rather go outta control then to be under it
Yo, how you goin' against us
When we got nothin' to lose?
Must be confused
Prayin' to a god that don't excist
That wouldn't save yo bible kissin' asses
Even if he did
We like to twist the misted
Genetick dead end
Don't got friend
Skam is chatter man
Posin childeren for depression
Stressin ANY language
Say my name IN SPANSIH
(That's EL CHUPACABRA!)
Suck the life outta you-ou
There won't be enough of your brain left
To fill a tea spoon
We two vanishin man that make the bad things blend
And probably go platinum on the day that the world ends

(Kwest)
When it comes to beef
I get relieved when I kill it brief
Send you a reef
Get your family ready for grief
I knock your teeth
Take a seat like a thief
Make a change of release
Burn or leave before you go beneath
Rappers I kill em
Down is to hell is where I send them villain
My plan is illin so much I need some peniculine
Cats is spillin 'cause I'm down here
Kickin shit that's solitaire
You crown is rip
Cause rapper you sound counterfeit
You get a round of clips
If you play hard
You stay scarred
Thinkin' of graveyard
You're in a caveyard
One in the mill
Son I'm ill when it comes to skills
Wanna get killed and catch a dum dum in your grill
Rappers demenishing is I get to the finish
I'm speaking English
While your brothers is speaking in gibberish
You touch a mic and
I'm out to burry your fingers
You want some fame?
I'll beat you up in front of Jerry Springer
So pay the price
Say the nice
When I pay the dice
I take your life
Slay it twice before your arrive

(A.L.)
Them cats who ride are feminine,
I'm singin' this without,
The benefit sense of cinnamon,
So submit it in your mental
Since you find it essential to sub the sentence
In sentence
This sentence is simple
You banned from using writing utinsels
Wether cry line, crayon pen or pencil
Observe verse with syntax
That causes skin cracks on impact
Send a rap shot before I spark back
And then send them whack men
Way back to the lab to add what most of them lack
I can hand you a manual of what I plan to do to you more tangible,
You still wouldn't understand the full concept
It slips through your fingers like sandgranuals
Skam will land, and we'll hand
And a blue sea anually
And you will see which animal me,
And fifty of us spittin' up that written stuff
It's all the same and
Is the reason for cyphas prematurely spittin' up
Ironic, phonic flow fo
Sho my flow is far from enbionic
To be honest when I'm on the chronic antibiotic
I'm beyond it!
The texure of my lecture is complex like a professor's
Scepticals think I'm exceptional when I bless sound recepticals,
What runs through my vest
To be turns crews to vegetables
Then grab my testicals and cup em
Fuck em, let's see whose fucked!''''''''''''''''
