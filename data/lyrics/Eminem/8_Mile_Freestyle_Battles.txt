Now everybody from the 313
Put your muthafukin' hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313
Put your muthafukin' hands up, look, Look

Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This free worlds got you all gassed up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf

1, 2, 3 into the 4
1pac, 2pac, 3pac, 4
4pac, 3pac, 2pac, 1
Your pac, he's pac, your pac none

This guy ain't no muthafukin' MC
I know everything he's got to say against me
I am white, I am a fukin' bum, I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy future is an Uncle Tom

I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl

I'm still standin' here sayin'
'Fuck the free world'
Don't ever try to judge me dude
You don't know wat the fuck I've been through

But I know somethin' about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
Wat's the matter Dogg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangsta, his real name's Clarence

And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage

This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause there's no such thing as half-way crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
In his fuckin' year book, fuck Cranbrook

Fuck the beat, I go a Capella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fuckin' white trash, I say it proudly

Fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people somethin' they don't know about me''''''''''''''''
