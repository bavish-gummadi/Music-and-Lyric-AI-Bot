(Rabbit)

Now everybody from the 313

Put your mother fucking hands up and follow me

Everybody from the 313

Put your mother fucking hands uplook, look

Now while he stands tough

Notice that this man did not have his hands up

This free world's got you gassed up

Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf

1, 2, 3 and to the 4

1Pac, 2Pac, 3Pac, 4

4Pac, 3Pac, 2Pacs, 1

You're Pac, he's Pac, Yo Pac; none

This guy ain't no mother-fuckin' MC,

I know everything he's got to say against me,

I am white, I am a fucking bum

I do live in a trailor with my mom

My boy Future is an Uncle Tom.

I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob

Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun,

I did get jumped, by all six of you chumps


And Wink did fuck my girl

I'm still standin here screamin "F**K THE FREE WORLD!"

Don't never try to judge me dude

You don't know what the fuck I've been through

But I know something about you

You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school

What's the matter dawg, you embarrassed?

This guy's a gangster; his real name's Clarence

And Clarence lives at home with both parents

And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage

This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook

'Cause ain't no such things as half-way crooks'

He's scared to death, he's scared to look

In his fucking yearbook, fuck Cranbrook

Fuck a beat, I go a cappella

Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailor, fuck everybody

Fuck y'all if you doubt me

I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly

And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie,

Here, tell these people something they don't know about me.''''''''''''''''
