I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss
I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss
I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss
I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss

(Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9")
Uh, Nickle nine a nigga twitter beefin' first rapper that shot a fan
Gucci's my absolute state of mind, like Waka's man
Chopper's brand, getting head in the car park, new Gallardo
This bitch sucking my dick today, call yesterday's news tomorrow
Stretch a nigga out, I'm the new Tae-bo, 'bout to cross over, I'm the new Iver
'Bout to saves a couple of these bitches that's right, I'm the new Bible
You? You 5.0, me? I'm all grounded to punishments, but I'm too fly though
Y'all niggas be winin', I should call you Moscato

(Eminem)
Look down at the floor board
Looks like someone left a pair stiletto shoes in my Tahoe
Never know what type of a hoe inside of my ride I may let
Last night at 5 AM, and she ain't even recover from last Friday yet
Hoes all over the ride like it's an ice cream truck, I can see why they fret
I already ran over two hoes and I ain't get up the fucking drive way yet
Soon as I open the door, you try to resist, what for Get in girl, don't front shorty
You're Fightin' an unwinnable war, it's useless, like tits on a bull, little tits on a whore
Got a mack and it's full of brats kicking and screaming like little kids throwing fits on the floor
Get in the whip, but you ain't turning this frog into a prince
What you keep tryna convince me for?

I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss
(No you don't)
I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss
(Not from me)
I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss
(Not on the lips are you crazy)
I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss
(Maybe the cheek but that's all you gon' get from me)

(Verse 2: Eminem)
Now you in my whip as long as you understand that I can't be whipped
You sick of companionship I say abandon ship, I'm a gigolo so you know, I'm always on the go
I ain't got no time to slow down for no relationshit
Drop the P and add a T, yeah, you can get mad at me all you want
But I'm ghost before you can even say boo, hun let alone call me one
A one-night stand is all he wants with a female fan, yeah one like Stan,
And he's so about a night stand in his bedroom has two lamps,
And only one nightstand. get the hint,
Ooh yeah boo, Ew, I ain't finna' to argue but why
You think they call it boo? cause it sound like it's supposed to scare you

(Royce Da 5'9")
Oh Ho, we can share you in the back of the Mclaren, I don't give a fuck
What your name is, Were gunna call you Hot and Bi, I hope your Bi,
But in the mean your name is Sharon
Slow the flow down so I can what
Tell your same face when I'm shooting guns is the same face I make when I fuck
From back of my hand on your neck pressing your face against the sheets it's insane
You then change, 'cause I'm out of this world, girl I got that Milky Way dick vein
I'm at an all-time high with highness, I'm at an all-time fly with flyness
And this is exactly what they say when they bow to your highness

I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss
I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss
I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss
I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss

(Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9")
Push a chick out the car when it's moving like waka's man
Her bottom's dark, but her top it tan
Her private parts got here on the pole
Like the opposite of her papa's plan

(Eminem)
Come on stripper! Let's hit the strip 180
Throw it in reverse and drop the trans
I'm in a trans man look at this bitch dance

(Royce)
Looking at this tramp, like what you wearing
Girl quit playing!

(Eminem)
Yeah bitch in them scrach 'n' sniff pants
Well let me scratch em

(Royce)
Let me sniff yeah
What? Did I say that?
I'm on lean like styrofoam cups and kickstands

(Eminem)
Middle finger stuck on fuck, stiff hands
But girl you got a butt like no if, ands
So yeah what the hell maybe
Awe hell Shady, he'll tell her like it is
So tell Katy Perry he's on her tail he's tail gating
These bells are my mating call, and I'm here bell's waiting
And tell Lady Gaga she can quit her job at the post office
She's still a male lady!
Wouldn't fuck her with her dick, you heard it, the verdict's in
He's allergic to divas, he'd take meat cleavers to 'em,
He don't give a damn about Bieber doin'!
What a demon, a behemoth, evil just seems to be seething through him

(Royce)
I like the strip tease you doing
This evening, you and me gonna find
3 more chickadees and have a menage like Nicki
You hot like dickee outfit in Texas
Without your under it sweatin
Suck my dick, we both gets to steppin to my logic

(Eminem)
My god trick, My dick is as hard as a yardstick
What we gonna do? Ride around till we're carsick
Then I'm gonna put this shit in park like dog shit
And you can blow me in the dark in the parking lot
Of a trailer park by the garbage
What you waiting on Me to roll up the carpet?
The condoms are in the glove compartment, lets start it!
Think I'm joking? What, am I sitting here
Trying to make fake farts with my armpits?
Tryin' to get you to sniff pot through your nose
Am I here to amuse you? Stop it.

(Royce)
I'm in your pocket outside of a church
The other hand reachin' for the bottom of your purse
You giving me head in a boxing stance
My dick's so big you could drop it in dirt
I'm not your man, we're sparring partners
There's 5 things you are in charge of, that's
Sucking a dick, sucking a dick, sucking a dick
Sucking a dick, sucking a dick

(Eminem)
If you ain't sucking a dick
Why you sitting there with puckered lips? That's collagen
Motherfucking bitch, what you mean how'd you
Get suckered into this you gonna jump into my truck
And then try to get truculent?

(Royce)
You should be suffering, you should be cooking
You should be buckling your seatbelt with oven mitts

(Eminem)
Excuse me while I make an ass of myself, but it's just
'Cause I wanna get...

I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss
(No you don't)
I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss
(Not from me)
I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss
(Not on the lips are you crazy)
I want a kiss, a Kiss, a kiss
(Maybe the cheek but that's all you gon' get from me)
