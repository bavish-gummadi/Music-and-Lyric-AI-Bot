The poor stay poor, the rich get richer, it's just so disproportionate

Sometimes life seems so unfortunate, that's why I don't give a shit.
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer, it's just so disproportionate.
You don't know just what I've gone through, that's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it, every rule, I'm breaking it

(Eminem)

Terrible but not rippable, invincible I hung invisible,
Fucking mistletoe over the world that stuck my ass up under it now pucker up them lips and kiss it hoes
Here we go
Bad and Evil so you know how this'll go the competition's miserable we stomp them bitches, this is no joke
Going overboard like someone threw us off the boat
Choke, apart from all the smoke
I'm trying to stay on fire so you know if I hate fucking water sprinklers I don't want a hoes
Someone left a cat out the bag now it's time to stuff his face
Bag in that bitch thought of that little motherfucker till it suffocates, who
You, handeling the ? tryna be so sick when the Bad and Evil was reunited hey
Came back to annihilate the games and dive straight this into this highway,
Word of Satan there's a drop full of ? Ouija board and I pray
Now I lay me down to sleep, I do this shit in my sleep
So now imagine if I awake!
I'm champ, bitch, I've never tasted Cannibus can never be no damn a wuss so pussy never mushy so you can't squish
No where near twisted, in fact if I jump out a ? taxi
Only time you'll hear me say I ambush
Outlandish, these words are weapons that I brandish
Stand off, wish the hoes get your hands off, this can't tie bitch
So why the fuck would I sugar coat it for?
No, fuck protocol, I'd holla at this whore but now my throat is sore

Sometimes life seems so unfortunate, that's why I don't give a shit.
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer, it's just so disproportionate.
You don't know just what I've gone through, that's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it, every rule, I'm breaking it

(Royce)
Baby I'm lawless, you couldn't burn me if you trew acid on me,
I'm at your homie, I'm at your home ready to spray you while you nappin' only have
Everything on and around your matrass looking like a world in front of a matrimony - you high
Thug yeah, go ahead, jump no matter how high you get, you're gonna come up short like Spud Webb
My DUI's get waved like saying bye, still rotten with no one else like James Todd can't change eye
I thank God for my safe thinking last time I was safethinking me and my niggers was doing a bank job
I stay violent y'all going to Beach Rock, you got a mouth like Kanye, I knock your whole bottom row of teeth out
No disrespecting Mr. West, shit I'm just nice with mine and it's just rap I'm just like Ricky Hatton, I just like to rhyme
These weak rappers wanna set us up, they never tough, they ask me for a hook I tell 'em left or right head or gut,
What you're all messing with, is a nigger that will leave you fubar, fucked up beyond all recognition
Y'all are rockstars, I'm the opposite, I could just throw a rock and hit a star, for the fuck of it
Partner you not hard I'll body you hot bars, beef has left you praying right, like allah hoo akhbar
Let's go, when I leave y'all shot you ain't gonna be on your metro, In a bad area they call?

Sometimes life seems so unfortunate, that's why I don't give a shit.
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer, it's just so disproportionate.
You don't know just what I've gone through, that's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it, every rule, I'm breaking it''''''''''''''''
