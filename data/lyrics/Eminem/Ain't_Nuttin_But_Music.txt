It's shit like this I kick to these rich white kids
Who just might see how fucked up this sick life is
Oops, I did it again, didn't I? My shit's harder
To figure out than what Britney's tit size is

Ooh, I probably pissed you off again, didn't I bitch?
So what? Christina Gaguilera kiss my grits
You know how many shit's I get if I wish I did
So, I can quit givin' these twisted little kids ideas

This just in, Britney just dissed Justin
She just fucked Ben, got tit fucked and dick sucked him
If Afflec can get his ass licked, how I can't shit
Goddamn bitch, I'm rich, I can't understand this

Are those pictures they made of us together on the Internet?
As close as I'm ever gonna get to hittin' it from the back
And shit when it comes to that I hit harder from the back
Than Everlast when he's pluggin' Lethal in his fuckin' ass

Just give me one more chance, Britney hit me one more time
Let me know what's on your mind, Whitney give me one more line
To sniff, you fuckers know what time it is
Fuck your jewelery, my record's almost diamond, beotch

What's goin' on in the world today?
People fightin', feudin', lootin', it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre, it ain't nuttin' but music

Eminem doesn't like N'Sync, well I do
So fuck him and the Backstreet Boys too
Whatever happened to the cast of Different Strokes
Mary's broke, Ty's snortin' coke and then an overdose

I got two little boys with me
Michael Jackson sent two helicopters to get me
I'm up early wit my hair curly
Me and Mr. Furly, fuckin' Laverne and Shirley

A lotta rappers are livin' in la la land
That's why I let my dogs out on the Baha Men
As bad as a life I had, I'm not mad
I don't need to be a jackass to beat up my dad

My whole family's country, my grandmother's old fashioned
And she keeps askin' me why I rap wit a honky
But Granny, I'm a flunky, I could be a junky
I could be hangin' with the hoochies out at the club scene

To all the independent women in the house, hey
Show us your tits and shut your motherfuckin' mouth, what?

Robert Downey, Bobby Brownie, Whitney Houston
The shit's confusin', Jesse Jackson, reverend scandal
Got George Michael's, Tevin Campbell's', PeeWee Herman's
Peep show places, public restrooms, peep those cases

What's goin' on in the world today?
People fightin', feudin', lootin', it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre, it ain't nuttin' but music

Huh, your mom and dad probably mad at us, for what?
We done turned their kids into little body snatchers
Ain't like where I'm from, we don't bite our tongue
Are you sure you want niggas 21 to carry guns?

It's sad but I'm glad that I'm made to rhyme
Where you work you ain't gettin' paid for that overtime
It's only music, media know it but they blind
I ain't in your light, so stay they hell up outta mine

Y'all the reason why Princess Diana ended up dyin'
If you people get offended I don't care, stop cryin'
Tryin' to get us to leave 'cause what we say just ain't clean, uh, uh
But holdin' back on what I say just ain't me

Now, what's these parents all mad for?
Your music is bad for, um, for teenage kids that drink
More than Ted Danson in Cheers Carson drink beers
We all fart and piss and cuss out our bitch, shut up

Broke or rich, I still do that same old shit
I don't jump in front of a camera and change no shit
So when they ask me about my sarcasticness
I just slap 'em, turn around and ask 'em this

What's goin' on in the world today?
People fightin', feudin', lootin', it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre, it ain't nuttin' but music
