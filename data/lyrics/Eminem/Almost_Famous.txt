Yeah, can't stop now
Maybe the last chance I get

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you can not fill these shoes

I just wanna be famous but
Be careful what you wish for

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist, they call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed up post office worker
A murker wit a Mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter

For a gangster ya sure did shit your pants when you saw
That chainsaw get to waivin' like a terrible towel
How things turn around when his fangs come out, get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowin' your mind, when I cum back like nut on your spine
I'm the thumb tack that you slept on, son
Now here I come screamin' 'a tac' like I just stepped on one

Low on the totem till he showed em defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit, his britches, he out-growed 'em
He's so out cold he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him, rigor mortis and post mortem

He's dyin' of boredom, take your best rhymes, record 'em
To try and thwart em, he'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit stained drawers, you gon' fuck wit a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips em in P.F. Chang sauce

Games off homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think im backin' down, you must be out of your dang skulls
I'm almost famous

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you can not fill these shoes

I just wanna be famous but
Be careful what you wish for

I'm back for revenge, I lost the battle, that ain't happenin' again
I'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory
Some are wrote on a napkin, I do what I have to to win

Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko
'Fore I take a shit in his jack-o-lantern and smash it on his porch

Now get off my dick, dick's too short of a word for my dick
Get off my anti-disestablishment-arianism, you prick
Don't call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer

I just laced my gloves wit enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Vern Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards, your Meni Me's
See he's in a whole 'nother weight class, he's slugs, you're bb's

You're bean bag bullets, you're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D-R-E
He's almost famous

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you can not fill these shoes

I just wanna be famous but
Be careful what you wish for

Now there he goes in Dre's studio cuppin' his balls
Screamin' the wood off the panelin', cussin' the paint off the walls
Spewin' his hate to these haters, showin' no love for these broads
He ain't givin' 'em shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard

He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark when it scars
Till Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out awww
His metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of suckin' him off

They can go get a belt or a necktie to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they're at it, he's fuckin' had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to Hell and build a snowman, girl

The bully's become bullied, if pussies get pushed then they better pull me
Take me back to ninth grade to school me
'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot, blow it
Who could have known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it

And while im being poetic, let me get historic
And raise the bar, higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bare witness to some biblical shit, there's a cold wind blowin'
This world ain't gonna know what hit it, he did it, he made it
He's finally famous''''''''''''''''''''''
