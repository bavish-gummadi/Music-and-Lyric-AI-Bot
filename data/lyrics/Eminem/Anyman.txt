Hi, original bad boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed puffy with mase
I laced the weed with insect repellent, better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling

With a capital, somebody grab me a snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my Adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her

I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said, "I'm ready now bitch, ain't you feelin' these kicks cunt?"
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell

I'm sick of these sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it, yuck

Hit you in the head with a brick till you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick till you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
'Cause your style is like dyin' in my sleep, I don't feel it

Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
Is fuckin' crazy, hello, hi

'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
Is fuckin' crazy

I'm ice grillin you, starin' you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case, I get chased by space aliens

A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium
Than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spazmatic
Strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed

Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flat lined, jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai weed
Lookin' Chinese, with my knees stuck together like Siamese twins

Joined at the groin like lesbians
Pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins, it probably all depends
On if I keep on killin' my girlfriends

Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
Is fuckin' crazy, hello, hi

'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
Is fuckin' crazy

'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
Is fuckin' crazy, hello, hi

'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
Is fuckin' crazy

Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
Shucks, I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I call in to work, 'cause all I do is frolic and play

I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be
Give me eleven Excederin' my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine

Scratched my balls till I shredded skin
Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been
It's probably AIDS, Forget it then
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows

That don't even make sense, like dyke's usin' dildos
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin' I get weeded
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it, damn''''''''''''''''
