The Armageddon Freestyle EMINEM

Fucker

Yeah
Oh shit, it's the evil genius
Green lantern
Yeah
A yo Em
Ha ha
What we call this shit right here
The invasion
You have part one you got part two now its
Part three
The final chapter mother fuckers
Armageddon, lets go

I got a riddle what's little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white fillin in the middle
That will do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean
Isn't it Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
His name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo so sorry wow
But that was a long time ago when I was just joe shmoe
Rappin' in joe blows basement I apologized for it befo, so
Either except it or you don't and lets move on
If I've shown that I've grown and get the bone
Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts
Keep walkin' around sniffin each others butts
Or should I say asses
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses

Hold up hold up hold up
New york city man
It's the kid Lloyd Banks
And it you hearin what I'm hearin right now
You know this ain't no regular shit homy
This something special and we gotta bring this back
Green common

Countdown to armageddon
Lets go

I got a riddle what's little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white fillin in the middle
That will do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean
Isn't it Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
His name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo so sorry wow
But that was a long time ago when I was just joe shmoe
Rappin' in joe blows basement I apologized for it befo so
Either except it or you don't and lets move on
If I've shown that I've grown and get the bone
Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts
Keep walkin' around sniffin each others butts
Or should I say asses
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses
The question I ask is
How can I explain this
How can I swing this in English language
If I switch to slang and turn man to man
Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain
Am I bein real or am I bein fake
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine
Or am I caught up in this hot water wody on my daughter
I told ya I love this culture don't let em' insult ya
I'm tell ya one me (a) gain this is the environment that I was brought up in
But every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration
Or should I say or should I say shun
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism
Your face is numb your stunned your look is cold
Like that of a man of seventy some years old
And it only gets colder which Is why I understand
And can't be mad at a forty four year old fan
With a chip on his shoulder who only owns a half of a magazine
And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again
Only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown
Papa can't stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
In his new chair that goes round and round
That he bought from new money in his bank account
That I get him every issue when the thang comes out
Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side
Yell Apartheid loud enough that he might slide
He might find someone dumb enough who might ride
But ain't nobody over here buyin two white guys disguised as pro black
There is no slack
Far heart for college great. In a fitted hat and a hunch back
Standin by the clearance coat rack
In some old slacks and tomorrows old throw backs
Yeah
Shady in the place to be c
And it takes what I got to rock the mic right
Still not gonna cater these punks
Fuckin' cocksuckin pussy lips haters dicks cunts''''''''''''''''
