2 Skinnee J's acting crazed as of late
Sorry, it must be something that we ate
Sensiated what we gave you
Our behavior will astound you
The artificial flavors all around you
Well, it's the flavor save ya save ya here to save ya
Or dehydrate ya
I'll back you up,
Pardon this behavior
Give me nutra-sweet
Powered cheese
Extra extra MSG
I come out of order,
So just add water
It's the starter of the armada
Not try to tarter
Any plate that I can make
Is something like ambrosia
Give me calcium propionate,
Sodium benzoate
Preserve me like the Everglades
Sckulactic acid I'll eat plastic if I hafta
Include the saccharin for a meal that's fantastic
Give me green #3
Or blue #2
It will all come together in the artificial flavor

Approach as I approach this topic and try to coach this
Artificial flava's got me bugging' like roaches

I'm getting busy like a bumble,
Now the honey's kinda funny
And the hive starts to crumble
I just wishful bliss in this life that I'm leading
But I'm dreaming'
Now the demon's feeding'
In Eden
Offers me an apple
But I know the shit's been sprayed with chemicals
And its detrimental to my medical
Condition
Concoction of a magician
Taken only under the advice of a physician
Delicious but penecious
So it ain't no friend of mine
The flavors artificial but the cancers genuine
As the cells swell
Like a wrist and a razor
Inhale the breeze of cfc's through my nasal
Passages
Ravages and contamination
Instant death,
The choice of a new generation

From the artificial flavor!''''''''''''''''
