The way you shake it
I can't believe it, I ain't never seen an butt like that
The way you move it, you make my *honk*
Go... d-doing doing doing
I don't believe it, it's almost to good to be true
I ain't never seen an butt like that
The way you move it, you make my *honk* go... d-doing doing doing

(Verse 1 - Eminem)
The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
She shakin that butt to the new Nelly jam-z
I think someone's at the door but I don't think I'm gonna answer
Police saying, FREEZE... d-doing doing doing
What do you mean freeze? Please I'm a human being
I have needs, I'm not done, not till I'm finished peeing
I'm not resisting arrest, I am agreeing Mr. Officer
I'm already on my knees, I can't get on the ground any further
It's impossible for me, and do not treat me like a murderer
I just like to pee, pee, pee, Yes, I make R&B I sing song, it go Ringy Chong ah Ching Chong Chong Chong Ching
Psyche, I joke I joke, I kid I kid. If offend, I'm sorry
Please, Please forgive, for I am Triumph, the puppet dog
I am a mere puppet, I can get away anything I say and you will love it

Jessica Simpson, looks oh so tempting
Nick, I ain't never seen an butt like that
Every time I see that show on MTV my *honk* goes... d-doing doing doing

Mary Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying, FREEZE... d-doing doing doing
What do you mean freeze? GEEZ I just got my seat
I have ticket, look I put away, my zipper zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theatre, please
I did not even get to see Mary Kate's shower scene


I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee Wee Herman
This movie's PG, Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simple plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyers with Michael, He's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears looks like a man
And I can say that and you laugh cause there's a puppet on my hand

Hilary Duff is not quite old enough so I ain't never seen a tush like that
Maybe next year I'll say butt and she'll make my *honk* go... d-doing doing doing

The way she moves she dances like a GO-GO
In that video she sings "get out" you bozo
I need a new boyfriend, Hi my name is Jo-Jo
Police saying, FREEZE... d-doing doing doing

What do you mean freeze? My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch. I just baked cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of these
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no not even me
I don't even know if I could say the word pee pee
Pee on the radio but I think I did
Janet is that a br-st-est? I think I just saw a t-t-it
Psyche, I joke I joke, I kid I kid
I don't think my joke is working I must flee
Quick, get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down

So Gwen Stafani will you *honk* on me, Please
I ain't never seen an butt like that
Cause the way you move it, you make my *honk* go d-doing doing doing''''''''''''''''
