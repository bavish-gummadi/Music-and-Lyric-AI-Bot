I'll spit a racial slur honky sew me
This shit is a Horror flick but a black guy doesn't die in this movie.
You gotta be kiddin
That makes me believe you really don't have an interest to livin'
You think these niggas gonna feel the shit you say
I got a better chance joining the kkk
For some real shit though I like you
That's why I didn't want to be the one you commit suicide to
Fuck lotto call me your leader
I feel bad that I gota murder that dude from leave it to beaver
I used to like that show now you got me in fight back mode
But oh well if you gotta go then you gotta go
I hate to do this I would love for this shit to
Last so I'll
Take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass
And alls well that ends ok
So I'll end this shit with a fuck you and have a nice day

Ward, I Think you were a little hard on the beaver
So was Eddie Hasko, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver
This Guy keeps screaming he's paranoid
Quick someone get his ass another steroid
Blah badi boo blah bah badi bloo blah
I ain't hear a word you said
Hipidi hoo bla
Is that a tank top or a new bra
Look snoop dogg just got a fuckin' boob job
Didn't you listen to the last round meat head
Pay attention, you're sayin' the same shit that he said
Matter fact dogg heres a pencil
Go home write some stuff make it suspensful
And don't come back until something dope hits you
Fuck it you can take the mic home with you
Looking like a cyclone hit you
Tank top screaming lotto I don't fit you
You look how far these white jokes get you
Boy's like how vanilla ice gonna diss you
My motto fuck lotto
I'll get the seven digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow (oh)''''''''''''''''
