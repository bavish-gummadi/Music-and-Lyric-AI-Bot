Now everybody from the 313 put your motha fuckin' hands up and follow me
Now everybody from the 313 put your motha fuckin' hands up
Look look

Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
The Free World's got you gassed up
Now who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf

1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1 pac 2 pac 3 pac 4
4 pac 3 pac 2 pac 1
You're pac he's pac You're pac none

This guy ain't no motha fuckin' MC
I know everything he's got to say against me
I am white I am a fuckin' bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standing here screamin' fuck the Free World

Don't ever try to judge me dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook
That's a private school
What's the matter dog?
You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster?
His real names' Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage

This guy don't wanna battle hes shook
'Cause there ain't no such thing as halfway crooks
He's scared to death
He's scared to look at his fuckin' year book
Fuck Cranbrooke

Fuck a beat I'll go a capella
Fuck Papa Doc
Fuck a clock
Fuck a trailer
Fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fuckin' white trash I say it proudly
And fuck this battle I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people somethin' they don't know about me''''''''''''''''
