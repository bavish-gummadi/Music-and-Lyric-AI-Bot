RAP
This guy's a choke artist
Ya catch a bad one
Your better off shootin yourself
With Papa Doc's handgun
Climbin up this mountain your weak
Ill leave you lost without a paddle
Floatin up shits creek
You ain't Detroit, I'm the D
Your the new kid on the block
Bout to get smacked back to the boonedocks
Fuckin' Nazi, this crowd ain't your type
Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I tell you, you better use it
This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music

Trailor trash, Ill choke you to your last breath
And have you lookin' foolish
Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that
Cause you follow Future like he got carrots up his asscrack
And when you actin' up that's when you got jacked up
And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up

Ill crack your shoulder blade
You'll get dropped so hard
Elvis will start turnin' in his grave
I don't know why they let you out in the dark
You need to take your white ass back across 8 mile
To the trailor park''''''''''''''''
