Turn me up, turn me up

Yeah'yeah I say-say this one for your sterio, turn me up, turn me up

Shout out sexy ladies
This right here is your
Song
Hop inside your car and
Turn your radio on

She blowing me kisses

I'm sitting and
Reminiscing'thinking
Dreaming.
She blowing me kisses
She blowing me kisses
I'm sitting and
Remeniscing'thinking
Dreaming
About us

I can take you places
Places you have never been
Caribbean, feet in the sand
I-i can take you around the word
And you can be my girl
And I can buy you
Pearls
And you can tell your girlfriends, how I put it
Down
And it's like a movie
Every time I come around
When I'm in your city
Man I shut the town
Down
Tell the whole world
That I'm hot right now.

Shout out sexy ladies
This right here is your
Song

Hop inside your car and turn your radio on
Shout out sexy ladies
This right here is your
Song
Hop inside your car and
Turn your radio on

She blowing me kisses
She blowing me kisses

I'm sitting and
Reminicing, thinking, dreaming

She blowing me kisses
She blowing me kisses
I'm sitting and
Reminicing, thinking, dreaming
About
Yeah

She like me, I like her
Knew-knew I would've
Wifed her

Who would've thought
That, she would
Been like

The other half of me what a sight to see
Me and her travelling, all across the world

I can be her man, she
She can be my girl

Turn the radio on she
Kissing me through the phone
When I sing her a song
When I tell its on

Till fade''''''''''''''''
