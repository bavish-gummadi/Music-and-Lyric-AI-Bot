(Dre)

All you see is the sun reflectin' off of the gun
Ready for the showdown to go down at 1
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'mma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waiting for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood run cold
It's time to reload this old 45 Colt
And the wind gust, it's hot and muggy, dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
I sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I could hear the sound of hooves
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and frooze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
But I'mma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head and this is what he said

(Eminem)
You never met, me
You'll prolly never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim
You want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm tellin' the truth, I got a price on my head too

Ya ride like a cowboy toward the sun
Life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as a outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
Ya ride till there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die

(Dre)
He was shady, you can see it by the look on his face
He said take 10 paces, shit, I took 8
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My shit went bang, but it only fired a blank
He said (You need bullets, hurry up, run!)
I put a clip in the gun and pointed it at his lungs
He pulled two at the same time and I stood stunned
(Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want)
I figured he was tellin' the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do, it's on you

(Eminem)
Did you recall when you and Snoop was a group? (the Chronic)
Well all we gotta do is find the map to part 2
Plus I know who's got it (Who)
Some old dude, He's got 26 plaques and he's already sold 2

(Dre)
I loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where I used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed his shot gun

(Eminem)
Dre here's the plot
This is the spot
They call him Doc Loveless
He's goin' around sayin' he took the game from us
(Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin')
He ain't go no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's more respected by the hip hop edge
My mission, is to get him to stop layin' eggs
And we could put him on his back down a flight of steps

(Dre)
I drew two guns and spun 'em on my fingers
Kciked in the swinging doors and started gun slingin
I could hear somebody singin'
Sounded like a g-thang and a verse from "keep they heads ringin"
I said it's Dre's day and started to spray
It's the 1800s, he pulls an AK
Hollow cliips started flyin' every which way

(Eminem)
That's when I saw Dre in trouble and game to the gage
I fired the first shot, He spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled''''''''''''''''
