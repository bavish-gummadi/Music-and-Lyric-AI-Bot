Oh shit
Guess what?
I ain't coming in yet, I'll come in a minute
Aiyo, this is my love song. It goes like this

Back when Mark Wall burg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix in with Bacardi dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you gone probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my pre-diction is that you gone probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall

And every things spinnin' your beginning
To think women are swimmin' in
Pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wildin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart rhymin'
Get in the car and start it and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42 car pile up

Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet sir, no sign of it
All I could see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place I'm outta place
I'm in in outter space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
(Whoa)
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
(Whoa)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay
(Whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold on me
(Whoa)
'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no
(No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go
(Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
(Whoa)
Is drug's really gotta hold on me

In third grade all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play rubix cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Joo
Schemein' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I got no game, and every face looks the same
They got no name, so I don't need game to play

I just say whatever I want, to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However I do show some respect to few
This ecstacy has got me standin' next to you
Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you

But your on it too, so you tell me you love me too,
Wake up in the morning like "What the fuck we do?"
I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run these drugs are gonna catch up sooner or later
But fuck it I'm on one, so let's enjoy
Let the ex destroy your spinal chord

So it's not a straight line no more
So we walk around lookin' like some wind-up dolls
Shit stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hit's won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
(Whoa)
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
(Whoa)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay
(Whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold on me
(Whoa)
'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no
(No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go
(Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
(Whoa)
Is drug's really gotta hold on me

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow when you swallow it all
Wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow your probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend, screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning? and what's a little fight
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marajuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?

It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
'Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin
But your young, you got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now I wouldn't

I woulda did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now, and upgraded and graduated
To better drugs and updated
But I still gotta a lot of growin' up to do
I still gotta whole lot of throwin' up to spew
But when it's all said and done before I know it
I'll be forty wit a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap
Babysitting for Hailey, while Hailey's out gettin' shmashed

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
(Whoa)
Someone keeps pullin on my sleeve
(Whoa)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay
(Whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold on me
(Whoa)
'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no
(No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go
(Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
(Whoa)
Is drug's really gotta hold on me

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
(Whoa)
Someone keeps pullin on my sleeve
(Whoa)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay
(Whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold on me
(Whoa)
'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no
(No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go
(Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
(Whoa)
Is drug's really gotta hold on me

Drugs really gotta hold on me
Really got a hold on me
Drugs really gotta hold on me
They really got a hold on me''''''''''''''''
