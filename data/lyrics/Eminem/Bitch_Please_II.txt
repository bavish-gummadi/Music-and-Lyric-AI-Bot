Snoop & Dr. Dre
(Yeah, what up Detroit?) 
Nah-uh, nah-uh, uh-uh, oh no, he didn't 
They didn't do it again 
Wha-what? What? 
You shit on these niggas two times Dr. Dre? (Oh fo'sho) 
Uh-uh, no 
You smell that 
This is special right here 
It's a toast to the boogie baby 
To the boogie oogie-oogie 
Yeah, y'know 
What's cracking, Dre? 

Dr. Dre
Just let me lay back and kick some mo' simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit, start riots like  (Limp Bizkit)
Throw on Guilty Conscience at concerts
And watch mosh pits till motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
(That's right, nigga)

Some of these crowds that Slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds, me and Snoop draw
Is niggas from Crenshaw, from Long Beach to South Central (Whoa)

Not these niggas again, these grown ass ignorant men
With hand triggers again (Shit)
You and what army could harm me
D-R-E and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach
(Snoop, Eastside)

We came a long way to making these songs play
It a be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long uzi, and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just being Andre
But I

Snoop
Somehow, someway, hello, nigga
You know about Doggy, Snoop Dogg
Now let me cut these niggas up
And show 'em where the fuck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin' with the shit that I be spittin', son

Hit and run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about 50 guns, and I love all of 'em the same
Bang bang
Damn, baby girl, what's yo name?

I forgot, what'd you say it was?
Damn, a nigga buzzed (Fucked up)
Hangin' in the club wit my nephew, Eminem
(What's up, Slim?)
What up, cuz?
(What's up, Snoop?)
The great white American hope
Done hooked up with the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast, baby

Nate Dogg
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat

Snoop
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Xzibit
I'm the head nigga in charge
I'm watching you move
You're found dead in your garage
With 10 o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it, 'cause I expose the fasciad
Your little lungs is too small to hot box with God

All jokes aside, come bounce wit us
Standing over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a body bag, but never in cuffs

So who do you trust, they just not rugged enough
When things get rough, I'm in the club shooting with 
Bitch, please, you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, come on

Nate Dogg
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat

Snoop
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Nate Dogg
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
Snoop
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Eminem (Snoop)
Ah no, Big Slim Dogg, 80 pound balls (What?)
Dick six inch long (Huh?)
Back up in the heezy, baby
He's Shady (He's so crazy)

Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right?
I'm just a criminal making a livin' off the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right?

To say what I like and walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the 'burbs
Dreamin' at night and screamin' at mom's schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me

I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down is a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude is being this mean

So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard tea CD using the fag word so freely
It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot
You happy now? Look here

I start some trouble everywhere that I go
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know
I start some shit, they throw me out the back do'
Come back and shoot the club up wit a fo-four

Nate Dogg
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat

Snoop
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Nate Dogg
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat

Snoop
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Xzibit
2001 and forever
Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, X to the Z, Nate Dogg
Come on, yeah''''''''''''''''''''''''
