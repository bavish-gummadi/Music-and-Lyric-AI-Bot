{Just pull the plug!
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it}

Eminem:
Hand me an .8
Beam me up and land me in space
I'm a sit on top of the world {I'm here
And shit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than I'll
Scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill {ah
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot
And people goin' feel me 'cause I'm a still be
The mad rapper whether I got money or not {yup
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin' makin' fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might get sent up back-strike in a Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicadin for
Everybody's pissin' me off; even a No Limit tank looks like
A middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit I'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would I kill you and jump in a grave and bury myself

{Just pull the plug!
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it

Eminem:
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Rosco beating James Tar Senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {ouch ouch
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person
Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps (ah)
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

{Just let it go
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal

Eminem:
My basic disk will make you take a razor into your wrist
Make you satanistic
Make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains
Are rippin' out your skull so bad
To sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a "Role Model, " I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gil was payin' me to dishwash
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You may be gettin' a bigger attitude than maybe Kim's got
And the shit's almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I know that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much
And Just the Two of Us
That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life
It's just words on a mic.
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch

{Just let it go
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it
