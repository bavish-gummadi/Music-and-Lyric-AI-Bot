Eminem has a line full of chainsaws
Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem
Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapperEminem

Who can say fore sure?
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Society would reap a great benefit

I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
on who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of Tourettes
Fuck f-fuck fuck, can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses

Angry and take it out on the neighbor's hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches
With these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this
Mess and make the best of this situation, I guess

'Cause I feel like a little bitch this predicament's despicable
I'm sick of just getting pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a freaking wuss, a pussy
This kid just took my stick of licorice
And threw my sticker books in a picker bush

I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was 12 and was 6 foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell, I got back up, all I did was book
Now there's using your head

Mama always said "If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous" (Mama could be wrong)
Mama, I'mma grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus (Mama could be wrong)

I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Mama always said)
"Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless

Fast forward some years later, a teenager, this is a fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished
They've stomped me into the mud for what reason, you stumped me

But how do you get the shit beat out of you be down and be upbeat
When you don't have no-thing, no valid shot at life
Chance to make it or succeed
'Cause you're doomed from the start
It's like you grew up on drug street, from jump street

But if I had just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task
Practicing trash talking in a trance
Locked in my room yeah, but I got some plans mama
These damn rhymes are falling
Out of my pants pocket I can't stop it

And I'm starting to blend in more, school this shit helps for sure
I'm getting more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that
Threw my first punch, end of story
Still in my skulls a vacant, empty void
Been using it more as a bin for storage

Take some inventory and as gorge as a Ford engine door hinge
Syringe an orange an extension cord and a Ninja sword
Not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored ironing board
A bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore

Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain
Like an independent store, something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't
'Cause I'd probably be Dahmer 'cause mama always said

Mama always said "If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous" (Mama could be wrong)
Mama, I'mma grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus (Mama could be wrong)

I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Mama always said)
"Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless

Now my mum goes womp womp womp
'Cause I'm not that smart but I'm not dumb
I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped
But somehow, I came out on top

I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, yo, fuck it I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go, they scream out 'Go'
I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household

Outsold the sell outs, freak the hell out
Middle America, hear them yell out
Until they were so scared, and those kids
Just about, belted out
Whatever spout that it fell out
Of my smart-aleck mouth, it was so weird

Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Motherfuckin' difficult, yeah, till then
Hopefully you little homos get over your fears and grow beards

It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers
Till emotions evoke tears, my whole careers a stroke of sheer genius
Smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You motherfuckin' (insert insult here)

Who the fuck would've thought that one little lone MC
Would be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it
And boy did they flock
Can't believe this little hick locked
This Hip Hop shit in his hip pocket
And still the shit got that
White trash traffic and gridlock
Shit hopping like a six blocks from a Kid Rock
Insane Clown Posse concert in mid-October

And God forbid I see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium dog
'Cause I turn into the Unabomber mama always said

Mama always said "If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous" (Mama could be wrong)
Mama, I'mma grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus (Mama could be wrong)

I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Mama always said)
"Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless

Insaneness ain't even a word you stupid fuck
Neither is ain't''''''''''''''''''''''
