(Dr. Dre)
Marshall, sounds like an S.O.S.

(Eminem)
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics Andr, you're fucking right!

(Dr. Dre)
To the rap mobile, let's go! 

(Lady)
Marshall!
Marshall!

(Eminem)
Bitches and gentlemen
It's showtime
Hurry, hurry step right up
Introducing the star of our show; his name is

(Lady)
Marshall!

(Eminem)
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without futher ado, I bring to you

(Lady)
Marshall! 

(Eminem)
Your 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old doc is back

Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh god, Sadam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges

Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrrm, vrrm, yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-11, so

Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?

(Dr. Dre)
(Hell yeah!)

(Eminem)
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?

(Dr. Dre)
(Hell yeah!)

(Eminem)
Quick; gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee wilikers, , holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone. Time to get rid of these rap criminals

So skip to your lou, while I do what I do best 
You ain't even impressed no more; you used to it 
Flows too wet, nobody close to it 
Nobody says it, but still everyone knows the shit

The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exagerate it all so much 
They make it all up; there's no such thing 
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans

It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rappin', and you know what for 
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome ya'll
To Marshall and Andr's carnival. C'mon now!

Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?

(Dr. Dre)
(Hell yeah!)

(Eminem)
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?

(Dr. Dre)
(Hell yeah!)

(Eminem)
It's just like old times: the dynamic duo 
Two old friends; why panic? You already know
Who's is fully capable, the two capped heroes
Dial straight down the center 8-0-0

You can even call collect, the most feared duet 
Since me and  played career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink or get to busting a sweat 
People stepping over people just to rush to the set

Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?

Turn on these beats MC's dont see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone; the game needs me

Till we grow beards, get weird, and disappear 
Into the mountains; nothing but clowns down here
But we ain't fucking around 'round here 
Yo, Dre! (What up?) Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Hell yeah!)

Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?

(Dr. Dre)
(Hell yeah!)

(Eminem)
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?

On these clowns. Can I get a witness?

(Dr. Dre)
(Hell yeah!)

(Eminem)
So there you have it folks 

(Lady)
Marshall!

(Eminem)
Has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andr
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because

(Lady)
Marshall!

(Eminem)
And Andr are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray

(Lady)
Marshall!

(Eminem)
So until next time friends 
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night everyone; thank you for coming
Your host for the evening

(Lady)
Marshall!

(Eminem)
Oh, hah''''''''''''''''''''''
