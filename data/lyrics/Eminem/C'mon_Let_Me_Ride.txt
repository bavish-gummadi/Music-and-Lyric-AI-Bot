If you got a sweet tooth,
You can taste my watermelons
If the swing set bores you
I can show you all my talents
I can wear a tail, like all the b-tches can't
You can have all this, boy!
And there's only one thing that I want from you

Come on, let me rock your bicycle
It's so fantastical, I'm your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it's only natural
Yeah, come in, come in, come in
Run in, run in, run in
Come on, let me rock your bicycle
It's so fantastical, I'm your bicycle

I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike

If the world starts freezing, I can make it hot and humid
If you get a bee-sting, I can suck out all the poison
I can make you last, like all the bitches can't
Have I made it clear, boy?
There's only one thing that I want from you

Come on, let me rock your bicycle
It's so fantastical, I'm your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it's only natural
Yeah, come in, come in, come in
Run in, run in, run in
Come on, let me rock your bicycle
It's so fantastical, I'm your bicycle

I'm always fucking with you
F-ck you for thinking it's true
I'm not like the things in this town
They make me blew in my mouth
I wanna ride on your bike
'Cause you're the boy that I like
It's like I oughta sell out for you
But your bikes are shiny and new

She's distracted, by my reflectors, man, I can tell the chick is attracted
My wheels spoke to her, my swing is a chick magnet
Bagging up chicks like a bag of chips
With a bag of prophylactics as big as Mick Jagger lips
Shagging's not something I'm a pro at, but I ain't practicing sh-t
Allen, Iverson has safe sex, condoms are for practice, man, I skip practice
Flip backwards while I flip this bike on its banana seat
My fantasy is to have you f-ck with a cast tennis
Got this bitch gagging, they call me the broad killer
I'm the cousin of Godzilla
'Cause I spit fire and my dick is draggin'
Zig zaggin' up the avenue, pulling these chicks in my antagonist
Waggin', screamin'

Come on, let me rock your bicycle
It's so fantastical, I'm your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it's only natural
Yeah, come in, come in, come in
Run in, run in, run in
Come on, let me rock your bicycle
It's so fantastical, I'm your bicycle

I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike''''''''''''''''
