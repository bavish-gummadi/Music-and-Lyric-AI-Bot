I'm just ridin' and decidin' if I want someone to hold
No commitment I'm just gettin' laid, I can get 'cause
California, sweet California
Got the sunset on where we can hot it
Got me on a... ooh

Want somebody down wit your clown
Would you ridr around town
Would you let the sun hit your weed smokin'
Fuckin' take a shower
Lay down wit ya in the bed wit ya wide open
Got me on my back with my thighs wide open
I stay wet, I don't need no lotion
Meet me in the back of the spot love potion
Meet me in the sunshine stay west coastin'
Hit it from the side fly by sex motion
Do a drive by, fly high, fuck boastin'
Crack on mine, we merry eyed boatin'
In the sea fishin'
Beverly Hill ho, Beverly Hill pigeon
Beverly shoppin', Beverly men pickin'
Beverly hotel, Beverly sweet pimpin'
Compton game got Beverly men listen

I'm just ridin' and decidin' if I want someone to hold
No commitment I'm just gettin' laid, I can get 'cause
California, sweet California
Got the sunset on where we can hot it
Got me on a... ooh

Niggas wanna hit me from the where, the where
Spank me and pull my hair, yeah
Talk to me like you really care
Actin' all queer like you Fred Austaire
You think I'm stupid, don't ya
You think I'm a lay down and let you stick me
With your beat poker
Don't cha, mister Swiss mocha
You can come closer
You can come over
You can have a side on the ??? of my poster
Drunk or sober
May or October, come right over
Rub my shoulders, four leaf clover
No gun holsters, get fucked wake up with a hangover
Twelfth quarter nothing left when the game over
Wake up all alone nights get colder
See you the next day get a cold shoulder

I'm just ridin' and decidin' if I want someone to hold
No commitment I'm just gettin' laid, I can get 'cause
California, sweet California
Got the sunset on where we can hot it
Got me on a... ooh

Let's get it on we can meet alone
Get it on in the freak song
We can both get it on when the heat's on
Look, we can both do wrong
Spent too long, I grew too strong
I got full blown to guard my home
Got me a loan, bought me a home
Order mine to go, walk me a low-low
In the six-four, sittin' on chrome
Datin' ??? dipped in all gold
Rub with three hoes pick up three mo'
Buy some Indo, roll purple smoke
We all do the most, keep niggas close
Keep heat closer, avoid all vultures
Now to get in like we supposed ta
Sunshine, sunny state, California

I'm just ridin' and decidin' if I want someone to hold
No commitment I'm just gettin' laid, I can get 'cause
California, sweet California
Got the sunset on where we can hot it
Got me on a... ooh''''''''''''''''
