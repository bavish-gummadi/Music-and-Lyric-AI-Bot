Whooooooo Shady...

I used to be a man but now I'm a boy I used to treat my paddleing pool like it was a toy. But know I'm a bit more older I see what it is, it's like a fucking pair on conjoint simese twins twinnnns. One Day my mother said to me "why don't you ever play outside" I used to crawl under my pool and hide I used to weath and duck to avoid her but then my friend carrington came and destroyed her, I used to this he was a dude but then he became orfully so rude. He used to say "Oi Marshell go back to bed your not wanted no more" so I packed up my pool and snuck out of my living room it was dark and fuzzy and I counldn't see a boom I looked into the window and saw christiphor reades he was taunting me and laughing at mee so I took out my pool and hit him over the head I told him to go to my house and go under my bed.''''''''''''''''
