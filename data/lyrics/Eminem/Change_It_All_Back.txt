(Switch-B)

Yo,
If I could start from scratch, I'd change most of it,
If you gave me your trust, I wouldn't of broken it,
I shoulda helped you out, back in 97',
Shit I wouldn't of let you go I woulda made your life heaven
I woulda hushed my mouth, gave my shit up,
I woulda minded my own business, n not let things get fucked,
Up, I woulda gone to church, maybe become a saint,
Erased this so-called picture we paint,
I woulda bin a soldier, no matter what shit
I woulda bin perfect, the man you want-ed
I never woulda slacked, now this is a fact
I never woulda rhymed, ova this track
If you didn't want it, I never woulda rapped,
But this is my life 'n' we can't change that
I woulda bin there, I never woulda tried
I would never want to live, I never woulda lied
I woulda changed it all back, to the past you see,
I never woulda let you put your fingers on me
I woulda let you be, keep my hands off the gun,
I never woulda changed, never try for number 1
I would never of intervened, just you 'n' your son,
N now I'm revelating, putting it all into a song
I would never of invited you to any show I did,
I wouldn't of wanted you to show, even though you did
I would never shed a tear for a girl I can't stand,
I never woulda back-talked, never raised a hand
I would never want you to think, that this shit was planned,
I woulda let you go, but I didn't think you'd understand
That we could never be together, I could never be your man,
But if I could turn back time I wouldn't put you through this again
I never woulda thought, that we could be buddies,
I never woulda asked for any pennies of your money
But its just the way you were, you were so cunning,
That's why I couldn't be your man, n you couldn't be my honey
Now I gotta start from scratch, change my whole past,
I'd change it all, make sure I never asked,
You out on a date 'cause if I knew it would never last
I woulda forgotten all about you 'n' erased you from the cast
I don't make shit up, I speak truth if I'm rapping
But if I could go back in time, 'us' never woulda happened

Baby I'm sorry
It all ended in a hurry
I didn't wanna cause no worries
But now I gotta leave...

Yo yo ayo

I'm fed up wid bein rejected
Detected, by your radar
You heard me and you ejected the tape
No there's no escape
I can't believe there's no one here to see my true self, all they remember of me is rape
I try, I fail, I sigh I lie in my bedroom waitin for another world, I sleep, I die
In a dream waitin for you to come and sweep me away
It'll never come, it's like I'm dreamin' on hennesay.
I'm waitin for the girl that likes me for who I am
And looks past the shit in my life full barrier like a dam
This ain't no piss take
Words be spillin like a lake
And I wouldn't give to shits if you diss this like I'm a fake
I'm waitin for my eyes to awake, 'cause I've just excepted this reality
And there is a reason why a lot of people are still mad at me
From year 5, year, 6 it ended at year 7
My trouble years, this is true like the destruction of 9/11
I went down the wrong path girl but I promise
If you take me in now, I won't make a mistake
Or be a misogynist.''''''''''''''''
