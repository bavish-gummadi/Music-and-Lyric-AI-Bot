Cheddar, I can rip you to a shredder
Cheddar cheese, there's not a better MC then me
I'm B. Rabbit, bitch, sting like a bee
Float like a butterfly, what am I?
So what if I cut a guy? Did I stutter guy?

Leave you punch drunk from lunch, truck to shelter
You never felt the rag that held the skelta, melt ya
Got the belt for the welt to weight champ
You got in with a fake stamp

Garbage bag full of clothes, still pullin' hoes
Rip you from head to toe, from leg to bullet hole
Next gun, pull it slow
And aim at the free world before you let it go

Instead of oh, I just shot my dick head
And yes, you do gotta big head
I can't call it Cheddar, where's your wallet?
You're so drunk, you can out drink the alcoholics
Make them say, "Damn, Cheddar's the man
He needs a can surgically removed from his hand"''''''''''''''''
