Eminem-
Yeah ...
Definitely definitely definitely dope...
Definitely definitely K-Mart
Yeah Yeah
You find me offensive
I find you offensive for finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw out a line any fences
If so to what extent, if any, should I go?
'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the court room on the defensive
They say I cause extensive psycholgical nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too god damn sensitive
It's censorship and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now 'cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader and Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him off in between him and Lex Luther
I killed Superman I killed Super... Man
And how ironic that I'd be the bad guy kryptonite
The green chronic

'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi my name is...
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is...
Rain Man

Now in the bible it says
Thou shall now watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course it's intercourse and it bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during, or after performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today kids
In a more derogatory way
But who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say
Let ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre (what up?)
I got a question if I may (yeah)
Is it gay to play putt putt golf with a friend (yeah)
And watch his butt butt when he tees off (yeah)
But but I ain't done THAT
In football a quarterback yells out hut hut
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts, but just what if
It was never meant, it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
His teeny, tiny, little, round hiney
And he didn't mean it but his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details
But what if he pictured it as a female's butt
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
Till then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because...

'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi my name is...
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is...
Rain Man

You find me offensive
I find you offensive...
Shit this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider senses telling me Spider-Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next and open up a whoop ass canister
God damnit Dre where's the god damn beat (yeah) anyway
Anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it, I got it
High-five Nick Lechey stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon I'd
Grab the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can
And to my headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
And I don't even gotta make no god damn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shitttt

'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi my name is...
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is...
Rain Man''''''''''''''''
