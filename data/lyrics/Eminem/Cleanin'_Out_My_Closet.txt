Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind

All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'

Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? Imma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD

I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die

I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today

What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen

Bitchin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Mnchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony

And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom

But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what: I am dead - dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
