'Cause some things just, don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
So on a, bigger stage they came to see you spit your game, oh
But it shouldn't be difficult, to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game, cold as ice, you remain
Fuck 'em all, tell 'em all, eat shit, here we go again

Spoken:
So, goddamn.
Is it that time again already?
Haha, y'all don't look too happy to see me.
Fuck man, don't everybody welcome me back at once?
All right, fuck y'all then.

You can get the dick, just call me the ball sac, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch dog, fall back, you mutts
Fuck your worms, you've never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck-sicked, mommy
And my nuts licked, gobble 'em up trick, yummy
Bitch, you don't fuckin' think I know that you suck dick, dummy
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit, honey
Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny
Shorty, dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucka
Motherfucka' might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, 'cause I'm just a mean cock-sucker
This shit is on 'cause you went and pissed me off, now I'm shittin' and pissin' on
Everybody, give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So buck the Buddah, light a bong
But take a look at Mariah next time I inspire you to write a song (Come on)

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
When it snows, and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why, man I just don't, know
Kno-kno-know, know-know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
Blo-blo-blows, blow-blow blows
Oh oh-oh

Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon
Bruce Banner's back in the booth, y'all are sittin' ducks, I'm the only goose standin'
I'll set the world on fire, piss on it put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around
Mo'fucker, I'll show you pussyfootin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt, 'til it makes a queef, and sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin', you must have mistook me for some
Sissy soft punk, lookin' for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead fuckin' hater push me, I told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me
Call me a faggot, 'cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy, G's up, all you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down, Shady ease up
Man chill, naw I can't goddammit, rap is a landfill
Drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens, the world will
Stop spinnin' and Michael J. Fox'll, come to a stand-still

Durin' an earthquake, urine in your face 'cause you're fake
Ow what the fuck, that hurt, wait
Ow what the fuck, I just got struck
By lightnin', alright then I quit, God I give up
Call it evil that men do, Lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue
To Hell I'll send you, and just then the wind blew, and I said...

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
When it snows, and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why, man I just don't...
Know, kno-kno-know, know-know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
Blo-blo-blows, blow-blow blows
Oh oh-oh oh-oh

How long will I be this way, Shady until my dyin' day
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
So long, 'til then I'll drop the fuckin' bombs
Like I missed the pass when I went long
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh bitches don't like that, homie I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns and the Human Torch starts swimmin'
Man I'm a, cold soul, I roll solo so don't compare
Me, to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah
I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to dis me I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
The last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writin' this and I thought of you, so...

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
When it snows, and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why, man I just don't...
Know, kno-kno-know, know-know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows
Blo-blo-blows, blow-blow blows
Oh oh-oh oh-oh

I don't know... I don't know what caused...
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I don't know... I don't know but I'll...
Probably be this way 'til my dyin' day
I don't know why I'm so... I'm so cold
Mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me''''''''''''''''''''''''
