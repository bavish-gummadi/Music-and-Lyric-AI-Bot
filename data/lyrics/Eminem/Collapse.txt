Sometimes you feel tired, feel weak
When you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you, find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation not to give up
And not be a quitter no matter how bad
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

Till I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day, that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pinnin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when Ima stop sendin' 'em
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenalin shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxacillin's just not real enough

The criminal cop killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You are comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa shizzel my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzels forgot, slizzel does not give a fuck

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse

(Until the roof)
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
(The roof comes off)
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs)
Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out
(Give out from underneath me)
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse

Music is like magic
There's a certain feeling you get when you're real
And you spit an people are feelin' ya shit
This is your moment and every single minute ou spend
Tryin' to hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in

It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry, I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walkin' around like nothin's bothering me
Even though half you people gotta fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby an' Whitney, Nate hit me

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse

(Until the roof)
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
(The roof comes off)
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs)
Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out
(Give out from underneath me)
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse

Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC's heart
What is he thinking? I'ma not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse

My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bump some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse

(Until the roof)
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
(The roof comes off)
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs)
Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out
(Give out from underneath me)
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse

Until the roof
Until the roof
The roof comes off
The roof comes off
Until my legs
Until my legs
Give out from underneath me

I
I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels like no one could beat me''''''''''''''''
