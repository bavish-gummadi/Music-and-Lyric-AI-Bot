Good mornin
Haha, wake your mother fuckin' asses up
Hey yo what is the what?
Well come on in, you know what time it is
Stop sleepin' on my group, bitch

For whatever it's worth, it's worth me havin' my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lips to ever get ass squished
I just can't get past these little pissants
That wanna be brauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad, they can't stand it
'Cause we can and they can't spit (Haawk)
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap Then it's a wrap, Then it's a scrap
An it isn't rap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my passion
Is to smash anyone rappin' without havin' a slappin
Believe me I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
'Cause I'm tellin' you right now your not gonna like it
'Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me
You poke a stick at a bit, boy, you get bit, B
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me 'cause they just bounce off me like bullets do, 50
I'm the beautiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally (argghhh!)
I do this for Swifty
Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy, and Proof are you with me?

(Chorus: Eminem)
Come on in Everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
'Cause we get it on un- till the break of dawnin'
Wake your ass up mother fuckers quit yawnin
'Cause we ain't leavin' till 6 in tha mornin
So help us sing along with the words o' the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on in

(Swifty)
They said of me, the epitome of a beef starter
In a party with heat. It's hard to keep me without one
Fuck snubs, I walk in clubs with a shotgun
Constantly poppin' slugs. they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses, A halocaust to whoever ain't cautious
In a house full of dark shit, I'ma gothic death prophet. yo stop breathin
You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
It ain't about what you readin
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
Either that or we'll be beefin frequent
You n***az need a 'E' just to speak shit
An Your leader is a petite bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it an won't even keep it a secret
N***a I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?

(Chorus: Eminem)
Well Come on in Everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
'Cause we get it on un- till the break of dawnin'
Wake your ass up, mother fuckers. Quit yawnin
'Cause we ain't leavin' till 6 in tha mornin
So help us sing along with the words o' the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on in

(Kuniva)
Yo yo
I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like
"What tha fuck" did he say in his rap Em?
I can see that he just a punk
I mean these niggas'll squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, is my family a couple (???)
Am I (?????)? To emtpy out them (???)
To fight you in front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors I get points across when I write
Just emotion's enough to say "fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT?!"
I might as well give this up
But tha'd be selfish as fuck to leave D12 an' it's What?
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life


(Kon Artis)
I walk with a limp, pistol hangin' off'a tha hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fifth
Your carcas'll split even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out shootin at G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on movin key's
But every time we hear you kick it
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause n***az'll test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back
Or get your guts clapped outta your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred n***az from (???)
So get to gunnin if you comin'

(Chorus: Eminem)
Well Come on in Everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
'Cause we get it on un- till the break of dawnin'
Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin
'Cause we ain't leavin' till 6 in tha mornin
So help us sing along with the words o' the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on in''''''''''''''''
