I tell myself that I was doin' all right
There's nothin' left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

Can't you see what you do to me, baby
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy

I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic
One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy, the way we act like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit

'Cause the next day we right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us
We can't figure out if it's lust
Or if it's love which that is attractin' us to each other
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother

Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today

But you deserved it, you hit me first
And provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you

But if there's one thing about you that I admire, it's baby
Because you stay with me, maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you, I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside, I see a freakish little side

Like a devil in disguise
You're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your, personal vibrators
And dildos, you've fucked yourself so much
You barely feel those anymore, you're only 24
But you're plenty more mature
Then those other little ho's

Who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy, sexy, cool
Chillin' you play your position you never step out of line
Even though I stay in your business
You've always kept out of mine

I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
You ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did maybe you like me in charge
Baby, 'cause we're crazy in love

I go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

You are the ink to my paper
What my pen is to my my pad
The moral, the very fiber
The whole substance to my rap

You are my reason for being
The meaning of my existance
If it wasn't for you
I would never be able to spit this

As intense as I do, and the irony 
Is you rely on me as much 
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid to fuel in my fire
You're my entire supply of gas, the match and igniter

The only way that I'm able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel
I don't need you as much as I really need you
So you don't use it to your advantage

But you're essential to me
You're the air I breathe
I believe if you ever leave me
I'd probably have no reason to be

You are the Kim to my Marshall
You're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem
The Alaina to my Hailie

You are the word that I'm lookin' for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind

You're like the pillow that props me up
The beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half
The wife who never divorced me

You're like the root to my evil
You let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you
Before you beat the shit out me

And no matter how much too much is never enough
Baby, 'cause we're crazy in love

I go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh''''''''''''''''''''''''
