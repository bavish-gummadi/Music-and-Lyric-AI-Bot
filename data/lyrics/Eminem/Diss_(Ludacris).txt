Damn, why don't you ever go away, huh?

We need to stop this shit
And relize what you spit
It's meaningless garbage
To shake some ass and tits
Don't act like ur sick and imma gonna repect u
And leave hip hop alone
Go promote wack rap, Cool?

(Eminem)
When I turn on the radio, I get nauseous
Annoy your commercial garbage, And make sure I turn it off quick
U make me so sick, It's pointless to even diss
But I do it for the lute and MP3 page hiss

I try to teach kids
But their steady rocking, Eyes bopping heads to Ludacris
Swearing that he's nice, Come on he sounds like the newest sensation
To get the party dancing, And bitches asses shakin
Making hits faking quick, aching like you sick
I'll slap you with your own ryhme
O there's your greatest hit
Lazy kids with dope beats, And alot of blabling
In reality you get beat like Eric ? battleing
But it's not your fault completely
I blame promoters to, hyping up your CD when they got 34 interludes
Companies lute you, 'Cause ur making them lute
But when your one hit wares out, They'll drop you for good, your replaceable

Pretend you like Hip Hop, That's a no no!
Show your appreciation donate a Volvo
O no, That be to much to ask
Actin' like alaskins with that rented ice you flash
I'll come down to your street carrying burners
Now your block is hot! hot!
Like a heat contained thermos
Your nerves now
I see your eyes twitching, doing drags to females
Coming out sounding like bitches
Retards spitting disses
A bunch of carbincopyies
You must of failed the road test, Learning how to write beats
My street, only bumps but it's unreleashed
Fuck self reclamed kings of hip hop, There all weak
My ryhme shines brighter then any ice you rock
Ryhming in the hook 9 times, ?
Lame ducks running on stage with makeup, It's crazy to us
Real MC's take and get big cuts, Your finshed

Stop this shit
And relize what you spit
It's me and this garbage
Just shake some ass and tits
Don't act like ur sick and I'm gonna repect u
And leave hip hop alone
Go promote wack rap fool

Stop this shit
And relize what you spit
It's me and this garbage
Just shake some ass and tits
Don't act like ur sick and I'm gonna repect u
And leave hip hop for me
Go promote wack rap fool

Stop this shit
And relize what you spit
It's me and this garbage
Just shake some ass and tits
Don't act like ur sick you'll be out of fasion quick
Leave hip hop alone, you annoying piece of shit''''''''''''''''
