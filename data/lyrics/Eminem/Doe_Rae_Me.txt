(Ja Rule)
Em you claim your mother's a crackhead and Kim is a known slut
So what's Hailie gonna be when she grows up?

(Eminem - (Hailie Jade))
Hahaaaa, Yeah, come on
G G G G G-Unit
Hailie (What??)
Come here baby
Bring daddy his oscar (ok)
Were gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass (hehehe)

(Swifty)
I'm about to get rid of some hoes it's simple
I put the Murder Inc with lead and I'm not talking about a pencil
Look at what the fuck you dun got into
I see you found your nitch you're just a bitch with a menstral
Claiming you a murderer and spelt it wrong
You but the E before the D because that's all you on
You on Pac's dick (bitch) you a replica guy if he were still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry bitch keep it real life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of mothafucker ruins 3 deals that another nigga got you they didn't see skills
And I ain't playing you're a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be praying on his cover 'cause he need it
And you niggas hating shut your mouths
It's just the real niggas ain't buying that shit you put out

(Obie)
Doe Rae Me but we don't sing motherfuckers
So Murda Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleased on a team who expects nothing less then RnB coming from that regime
Regime is a little extreme neck to neck with soldiers motherfucking marines
Ja sold his soul to sing we have witnessed teen on the TV screen chase the dream
Now that you embrace the green don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a muther fucking actor slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billy Holiday how it happen?
Artists with repituares saw him in action, Pac's assassination
Def jam grabbed him, told him reinact him you'll go platinum
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins
Reinacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy
Match and destroy Shady slash Aftermath in detroit motherfucker

(Eminem)
Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da
Don't play me cause your washed up, lost your spot
Mama say mama sa Macosaca
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
Doe Rae Me 'cause we're hot and you're not
Going at me is the only shot you got
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
You can get popped after all that shit you pop

(Kon Artis)
Now we can skip past the mean mugs, get to the slugs
To grievence and the crying and intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga you shook,
You're half of a half wieght crook nigga get off X dick go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one and when you're gone you'll only be the late fake one
Nigga please stick the script before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch, fucking old ass ignorant innocent looking senior citizen
Built up slap you like renisanse sicitive wait a minute hold on
Is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on
A bitch made man now how you gonna connect
With them short ass arms like a Tyranasaurous Rex
You niggas can scream, holla and curse and go ahead and respond
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse

(Proof)
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stucky and bush stones
What's wrong? didn't think were strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
This real witness y'all ain't caught the concept
You're talking non sense to walking bomb threats
Contacts were blown by Benzetta in the Source
Threatning at the boss you're gonna see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerse to try serve on us
But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust

(Kuniva)
Do I gotta get my nigga bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscience and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Caddillac, Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this glock
That's right on the little shit you got left to help you eat
You not Pac's songs without laws will help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying to mock pac your mockavelli get your own identity

(Eminem)
Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da
(Don't EVER say my lil girls name in a song again)
Don't play me cause your washed up, lost your spot
Mama say mama sa Macosaca
(Fucking punk pussy, BITCH!)
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
Doe Rae Me 'cause we're hot and you're not
(I'm'a fuck you up boy)
Going at me is the only shot you got
(Never again in your mother fucking life)
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
(Gonna shoot the shit outa you little fucking midgits, Hailie will whip your mother fucking asses)
You can get popped after all that shit you pop

(Obie Trice)

Fuck Benzino, fuck Ja Rule
Nigga, this is Obie Trice right here talkin' to you mother fuckers
Ja Rule punk ass yeah
