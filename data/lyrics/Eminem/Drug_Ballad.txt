Guess what?
I ain't coming in yet, I'll come in in a minute
Hey yo, this is my love song
It goes like this

Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Henn' with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk

And by the sixth gin you gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is that you gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall

And everything's spinning, you're beginning to think
Women are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches

You have the right to remain violent and start wildin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyeing you
Get in the car and start it and start driving
Over the island and cause a 42-car pileup

"Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flying
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it

Let me out of this place I'm outta place
I'm in in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so"

'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa)
Something keeps pulling on my sleeve (whoa)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

'Cause every time I try to tell 'em no (no)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (go)
I'm a sucker, all I gotta say (whoa)
Drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

In third grade all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs

I got no game and every face looks the same
They got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want

However I do show some respect to few
This Ecstasy's got me standing next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck, spilling guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you

But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like "Yo what the fuck we do?
I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheating then I'm stuck with you"

But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna catch up sooner or later
But fuck it I'm on one, so let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more

So we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more

'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa)
Something keeps pulling on my sleeve (whoa)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

'Cause every time I try to tell 'em no (no)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (go)
I'm a sucker, all I gotta say (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all, wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it

And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?

It don't matter as long as you get where you're going
'Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're going
They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignoring
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning

But you're young, you got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now I wouldn't
I woulda did more shit that people said that I shouldn't

But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still gotta a lot of growing up to do
I still gotta whole lot of throwing up to spew

But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap
Babysitting for Hailie, while Hailie's out getting smashed

'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa)
Something keeps pulling on my sleeve (whoa)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

'Cause every time I try to tell 'em no (no)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (go)
I'm a sucker, all I gotta say (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa)
Something keeps pulling on my sleeve (whoa)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

'Cause every time I try to tell 'em no (no)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (go)
I'm a sucker, all I gotta say (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

Drugs really gotta hold of me
Really gotta hold of me
These drugs really gotta hold of me
They really gotta hold of me''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
