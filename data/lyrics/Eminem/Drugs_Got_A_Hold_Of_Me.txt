Yeah...(laughter)...whoooo... shit (a'ight) hmmm, whoa, hmm ...eeee
Guess what? eweee,
(I'm not coming in yet) dodoodo, (I'm coming in) in a minute
(Hey yo), ummmm, (a'ight), (this is my love song), (Hey Yo),
Hey yeaaa, (aight), (It goes like this...), (a'ight)

Back when Mark Wallberg was marky mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to... mix in with bacardi dark
And when it... kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the... sixth gin you gon probly crawl
And you'll be... sick then and you'll probly barf
And my pre-...diction is that you gon probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And every-... things spinnin your beginning to think women are swimmin in
Pink linen and in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wildin
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein' you
Get in the car and start it and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42 car pile up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot, looking for life on this planet sir,
No sign of it all I could see is a bunch of smoke flyin and I'm
So high that I might die if I go by it.
Let me out of this place I'm outta place, I'm in in outter space,
I've just vanished without a trace. I'm going to a pretty place
Now where the flowers grow, I'll be back in an hour or so.

'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa-o-o)
Something keeps pullin on my sleeve (whoa-o-o)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa-o-o)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa-o-o)
'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no (no-o-o)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (go-o-o)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (whoa-o-o)
Is drug's really gotta hold of me

In third grade all I used to do, was sniff glue
Through a tube and play rubix cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Schemein on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I got no game, and every face looks the same
They got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want, to whoever I want,
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However I do show some respect to few
This ecstacy has got me standin next to you
Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin guts to you

We just met, but I think I'm in love wit you
But your on it too, so you tell me you love me too,
Wake up in the morning like "What the fuck we do?"
I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do,
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna catch up sooner or later
But fuck it I'm on one, so let's enjoy,
Let that X destroy your spinal chord, so it's not a straight line no more
So we walk around lookin' like some wind-up dolls,
Shit stickin out of our backs like a dinosaur,
Shit, six hit's won't even get me high no more,
So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow when you swallow it all
Wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow your probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend, screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning? and what's a little fight,
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marajuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
'Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop but you just sit there and yawn, even though you wake up
Feelin' like shit every mornin.
But your young, you got a lot of drugs to do, girls to screw,
Parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now I wouldn't, I woulda did more shit that
People said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now, and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still gotta a lot of growin' up to do,
I still gotta whole lot of throwin' up to spew
But when it's all said and done I'll be 40
Before I know it wit a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap,
Babysitting for Hailey, while Hailey's out gettin' smashed.

Drugs really gotta hold of me
Really got a hold of me
Drugs really gotta hold of me
They really got a hold of me''''''''''''''''
