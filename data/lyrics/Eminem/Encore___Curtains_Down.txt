(50 Cent) 
Sh-Sh-Sh-Shady 
Aftermath, ha ha 
G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, ha ha 

First we came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight 
And if they don't let us in through the front 
We'll come through the side

'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without 
At least saying goodbye 
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right 
Scream one last time 

(Eminem)
Get your ass up for the Doctor 
One more time, get your ass up for the Doctor 
Come on now, here we go 
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger 
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat 
Get on down 

(Dr. Dre)
Times up, game's over, you lose, I win 
'Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here 
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin 
Look who's got you goin' crazy again

I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in 
I go out and just come back full circle again 
You a fad, that means your something that we already had 
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad 

(Eminem)
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you 
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you 
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you

Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin' 
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why 10 multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
Worldwide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin' 

First we came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight 
And if they don't let us in through the front 
We'll come through the side

'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without 
At least saying goodbye 
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right 
Scream one last time 

(Eminem)
When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk 
Crunk, crunk, crunk 
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump 
Jump, jump, jump, jump 

(Dr. Dre)
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it 
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches 

(Eminem)
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges 
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus 

(Dr. Dre)
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk 
Doc is all washed up, knock it off 
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'? 
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression 
You must be on the cock of Doc, 'cause Doc left you all guessin'

So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what) 
We gon' have this motherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump) 
That's why we always save the best cut last 
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

(Eminem)
'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators 
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers 
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap 
Maybe raised to be racist

Who may have never got to see our faces 
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages 
Broke down barriers of language and races 
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic 
And we can play the back and forth all day 
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to 

First we came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight 
And if they don't let us in through the front 
We'll come through the side

'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without 
At least saying goodbye 
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right 
Scream one last time 

(Eminem)
50 Cent, come on! 

(50 Cent)
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do 
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know 
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved 

(Dr. Dre)
And plenty honeys involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees 
Cali, every day it's just another party from the valleys 
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally 

(Eminem)
Hands up for the grand finale 

Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak 
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week 

(Dr. Dre)
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to 
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker 

(Eminem)
So nervous, ain't never 'cause Shady Aftermath together 
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady) 
No one could do it better 
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh 

First we came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight 
And if they don't let us in through the front 
We'll come through the side

'Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without 
At least saying goodbye 
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right 
Scream one last time 

(Eminem)
Yeah, ha ha 
Still Aftermath, 2006 
And don't worry about that Detox album 
It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, ha ha 

50 Cent, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre 
We ain't leavin', let's go! Ha ha 
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for comin' out, peace! 

...Oh shit, I almost forgot, you're comin' with me! *gunshots*
Ha ha, bye bye!
*final gunshot*

See you in hell, fuckers!''''''''''''''''''''''
