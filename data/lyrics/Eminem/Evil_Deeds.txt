spoken:
Lord please forgive me for what I do,
For I know not what I've done.

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Mama had a baby and it's head popped off, head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
My mama don't want me, the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off

Ring ring ring, on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn

Till somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle Edna 'n' Charles
Edna 'n' Charles, Edna 'n' Charles, Edna 'n' Charles, Edna 'n' Charles
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song
Sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song

It went a little something like Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Mama why do they keep saying this, I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black, well what about me
Where does that leave me, well I guess that I'm between predominantly
Both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'ma scream

While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like a comedian to you
Do you think that I'm kidding, what do I look like some kind of idi...
Wait a minute shit, don't answer that, why am I so misunderstood
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it such bullshit

Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again, whining about his millions and
His mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it

Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it, if you only knew the half of it

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds, please release me
From these demons, I never had any of this shit planned ma, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused, this Santa Clause, why you not comin' this year again

What did I do that was so bad to deserve this, everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know what to feel like, they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel

And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, do si do now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring around the rosie, the shows over, you can all go home now

But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
Till I pass  back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

I said father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Oh!

Last one, baby...
Let's go...
Detroit!''''''''''''''''''
