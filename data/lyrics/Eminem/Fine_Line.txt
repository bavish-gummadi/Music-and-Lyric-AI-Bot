Another day, another hotel, the inside of it's nice though
Oh well, this is my life so as I go and try to close for the nights show
To see how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business
Guess I'll just never get, so this shit just always feels so weird
To this day because alls I ever did
Was just say the shit I would've wanted to hear
Other people say to me when I was a kid
So please don't make me some type of hero
'Cause I will say some inspirational shit in a real way
But still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit
In the world and tell it to suck on a dick 'cause I still make fun
Of a sit' someone's in like a son of a bitch at another's expense
I'm fuckin' relentless as fuck when it comes to this pen
I struggle with coming to senses, stuck on the fence
On a balance beam if I seem unbalanced, it's challenging
But my conscience allows me to think the most foulish childish things
Without even blinking, without even thinkin' about
All the stinkin' amounts of people that seem to be reachin' for the crowds
They're screaming in The Palace, sold out this evening
But now as I lay me down sleeping
Is it really my soul to keep, or have I sold it cheap?
Is it greed? Do I take more than I need?
When I joke of leavin', but keep overachievin'
'Cause what it's stole from me I've barely broken even

I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying

So an artist how I paint myself
And through my heroine ordeals I'm so vain
I want my respect
But ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
Till I sit in the dark and I reflect
And my reflection shows what it's like here
Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights
Yeah, it's like a nightmare
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare
And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah
'Cause I swear to Christ there are nights where I stay up at night
And say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears
Cause this ice layer
I skate on's a nice way of putting it, but I like stayin'
Feistier then a triceratops and like a dice player
I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit
From this house it's quite big, but it ain't when you can't leave it
And I feel so isolated, nice I made it
But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song, it's a cycle ain't it
Then wonder why I stay famous
I keep walkin' the line
This gold fish bowl gets old
But especially when you don't know
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
Cause you don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier
Or you sold your soul

I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying

And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back to me

I still remember the times when
They were simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics
I'll never forget what that feeling was like
I miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a dime and, now I'm diamond
I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Stuck in this house hibernatin'
Hate even going outside it
Sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk in Target and look at shit Browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow, I must have had Alzheimers
Long time since I shouted them out, bout time
'Cause it's been on my mind lately how
Zee, you always supported me
You vouched, I will never forget that and
How you guys, accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too, you slept on my couch
And I been thinkin' 'bout the time when I slept on the floor at the outhouse
Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside I'm, I'll always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I

I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in a hole dying''''''''''''''''
