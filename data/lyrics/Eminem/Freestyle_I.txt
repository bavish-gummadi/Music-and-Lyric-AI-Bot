Im driven to write
Given the mic
Livin' the life
That you livin' at night
Just to live in the light
And deliver delight
And slither the slight sight
Of the life that ain't right
Into your mind
Meant to remind
U went through the grind
To get through the line
Ain't no more waitin
To reach ur goal
There ain't no more Satan
To impeach ur soul
He can't affect u
He can dissect u
And change ur mind
Bad thoughts can direct u
Defects can be gains
Ur worries are tainted
Mistakes can be saints
'Cause they can correct u''''''''''''''''
