Ayo, let me tell you about my homies, haha

My name is Chancey Billups, I'm kinda like a raunchy Phillips
Screwdriver, my crew's liver, when you can't sleep and you're still up
I get the ball then I'm like Rip, you can't get a grip
You prolly got stripped, wanna rumble, no reason to trip
I grab her like Gnarles Barkley holds a mic, your snarls spark me
I smile like Charles Barkley, come on, I'm hard, guard me
Ain't booin', ain't pursuin', no lawsuits, I ain't suin'
I know what I'm doin', give me the ball and your life is ruined
I'm like Rasheed I remind me of the spirit of Proof
I'm heavy, you're lucky, fall in the groove, and I'm on the move
I'm smooth with it, give me the ball, you don't know what to do with it
Shoot it in the basket, you other teams need a casket
LeBron's head, don't respond, there's no back'n'forth
This game is mental man, I play it loud
I walk away just hush the crowd, you try to touch, sit down

Detroit basketball
Homie like I told you this is...
Detroit basketball
Man I don't think you're ready...

I get the crowd rolled up like a U-Haul truck
Just call me two-balled Chuck
Ain't too tall? What? I'll leave Utah stuffed
Man I love this game, who the hell you called up
You need points on the paint, I'm the joints when they stained
All my coins in the bank, and I'm going on the way
(I-I-I-I-I-I-I get money)
Yeah baby it's true, I'm talkin' to you
You already know what to do, just pass it to me
It just so happens to be that I adapt on this heat
So strap in your seat, I got a grasp on this beat
You ain't convinced? Give it to Tayshaun Prince
We haven't stay calm since, lead the ball with delayed palm prints
Now homie this is (now homie this is)

Detroit basketball
Homie like I told you this is...
Detroit basketball
Man I don't think you're ready

We get everybody involved homie, we get everybody involved
I said
We get everybody involved homie, we get everybody involved''''''''''''''''
