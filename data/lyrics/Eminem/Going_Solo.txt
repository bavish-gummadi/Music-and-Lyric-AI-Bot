You really don't know me
I feel iscloated around you
You make feel strange and embarrassed
Don't wanna do a duet on the karaoke
I think I want to go solo

Going Solo Solo Solo
Don't need you anymore
Ill manage thank you
Without you making me look like a fool
I wanna go Solo Solo Solo... Solo

Think You can mess with my mind
But I'm smarter than that
Can't you read my facial expressions
Don't wanna do a duet on the karaoke
I think I want to go solo

Going Solo Solo Solo
Don't need you anymore
Ill manage thank you
Without you making me look like a fool
I wanna go Solo Solo Solo... Solo

Nothing can stop me
I feel like the brightest thing around
Nothing will make me be with you
Don't wanna do a duet on the karaoke

I think I want to go solo

Going Solo Solo Solo
Don't need you anymore
Ill manage thank you
Without you making me look like a fool
I wanna go Solo Solo Solo... Solo

Going Solo Solo Solo
Don't need you anymore
Ill manage thank you
Without you making me look like a fool
I wanna go Solo Solo Solo... Solo

Nothing can stop me from being here
In this position of being solo
And not doing a duet on the next karaoke
I think I'm good at...

Going Solo Solo Solo
Don't need you anymore
Ill manage thank you
Without you making me look like a fool
I wanna go Solo Solo Solo... Solo''''''''''''''''
