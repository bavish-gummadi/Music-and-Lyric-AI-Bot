I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

Lately I really, feel like, I'm rollin' for Delph like Philly
Feel like I'm losin' control of myself, I sincerely
Apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complainin'
But life keeps on complicatin'

And I'm debatin' on, leavin' this world this evenin'
Even my girls can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside I'm dyin', I am finally realizin' I need

Help, can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks I've been havin' ups and downs, goin' through peaks
And valleys, dilly dallyin', 'round with the idea
Of endin' this shit right here

I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight in mirrors
I can't stand what I look like yeah
I look fat but what do I care, I give a fuck
Only thing I fear is Hailie, I'm afraid if I close my eyes then I might see her
Shit

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall what happened that you can't stop with these pills
And you've fallen off with your skills and your own fans are laughin' at you

You've become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up
Be a man, stand, a real man would have had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say  just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust

Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at nobody, he'd fight first
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm poppin' Vic's, Perc's and Methadone pills
Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it

Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gon' do whatever I says when, I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin', best friend, so fuck it I guess then

I'm going through changes
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes
I'm going through changes

My friends just can't understand this new me
That's understandable man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do

I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame's startin' to give me an excuse to be at a all time low
I sit alone in my home theater, watchin' the same damn DVD

Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurt, so I fast forward, sleepin' pills will make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin' right

I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on dull 'em out
Daddy don't you die on me, daddy better hold your ground
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice, yeah baby hold me down

(Daddy)
I'm going through changes
(Daddy)
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes
I'm going through changes

Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, plus somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back, I'ma be bulletproof
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth

Shit, it just hit me that what if I would not have made it through
I think about the things I would never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too

I still love your mother, that'll never change, think about her every day
We just could never get it together hey, wish there was a better way
For me to say it, but I swear on everything
I'd do anything for her, on any day

There are just too many things to explain, when it rains
Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows I never been a saint

I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today, I looked at your picture almost if to say
I miss you sub-consciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say

I guess I'm I'm going through changes
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes
I'm going through changes''''''''''''''''''''
