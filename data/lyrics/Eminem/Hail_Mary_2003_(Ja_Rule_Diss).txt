(Erv Gotti)
Everybody wants to make comparisons to Pac, and X, and me, YALL NIGGAZ want to see Pac come back? You want to see this shit? it's here nigga, it's here

(Eminem)
Makaveli rest in peace
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Mouth like a .12 gauge shot it (feel me)

(2x)

(HAIL MARY} Come get me
If you mothafuckers want Shady
{Background:
And ja said he shall be the lost begotten seed of 2pac
To lead this industry into the ways of the man
Follow me
Keep my mesh vest as pacs vest}
If Pac was still here now,
He would never ride with Ja,

(Eminem)
You ain't no killa, you a pussy
That exstacy dun' got you all emotional and moushy
Bitches wearin rags in photos, for Ja's words bein quoted
In the SOURCE, stealin 'Pac's shit like he just wrote it
You loud mouth, pray to God, hopin no one's listenin
See 50 comin' for me, Oh my God my, my position
No one pays attention
To me, please Gotti, here I go
Gimme this pill, exstacy dun' got me feelin' so
Invincible
Now all of a sudden I'm a fuckin' mad man who screams
Like I'm 'Pac but I'm not, enemies, Hennesy
Actin' like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm CRAZY
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fucked from this shit
I'm stuck, I'm addicted to these drugs, I'ma quit
Sayin' mothafucka's name's before somebody fucks me up
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you hell, fucker

(Eminem and Busta in background)
Come get me
Motherfucker, If you want Shady
If Pac was still here now,
He would never ride with Ja

Get off that E
Before you try to come and fuck with me
It's Aftermath here now
Shady Records got it locked
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

(50 Cent)
Penitentaries is packed with promise makers
Never realized the precious time them bitch niggas is wastin
Insitutionalize, my bitches bring me product by the bundles
Hustle hard for myself, G-Unit mothafucka, WE BALLIN
Catch me count trees and when I'm callin
Can you accept my call, Ceo let me sip on Henessy, "Can I sip some more?"
Hell, I done been in jail, I ain't scared
Momma checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Mothafuckas thinkin' they can stop 50... they losin it


Lil' nigga named Ja, think he live like me
Talkin' about he left the hospital, took 9 like me
You live in fantasies nigga
I rejected ya deposit
When your lil sweet ass goin' come out of the closet
Now he wonderin why DMX blowed him out
Next time grown folks talkin' bitch close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done Seen too many real niggas ballin let these bitch niggas beat me
Black, yous a mothafuckin punk and you'll see me with gloves
Quit scarin them fuckin' kids with you ugly ass mug
And you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's goin' on
Nigga pay back Tah, I know your bitch ass from way back
Witness me strap with macs You know I don't play that
All these old rappers tryin' to advance it's all over now -- take it like a man
HAHA--Irv lookin' like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Tryin' to playa hate on my shit- Man eat a fat dick
Lovin' this shit that's how you made me
Feelin' like I got you niggas crazy (Uh huh)
Against all odds up lettin my thug mothafuckas know
This'll be the realist shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blow to the truest shit I ever spoke, 21 gun salute

(Fades in) Busta Rhymes:
Hey yo I've been one of the most humble, rep the streets to the core
Hey Jeffrey, What the fuck you come involvin me for?
It's been a long time comin' like a blessin to a check you
See 106 and park fans don't even fuckin' respect you
Its kinda funny wanna be Pac, wanna fake like he thug
Runnin' around talkin' shit that he ain't capable of
Now let me OFF this cock sucka watch me handle you nigga
If I recall Violator used to manage you nigga
Take took a closer look and realized you was an impostor
There's never been a Violator on a Murda Inc roster.
Dumbass Now who shoot?
Oh I made you look, you said Bus' singin' the same ol' hook,
You Stupid if y'all shoot
I take a look at ya man tha bitch shot himself in front of Def Jam
Chedda Bob ass niggaz start adjustin ya plan
You let the streets down nigga 'pologize to ya fans
Watch ya pull a lil stunt like we ain't know what it was
Lil faggot desperate tryin' to re-establish a buzz
I know tha shit is drivin' you crazy You wonderin how
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice what you gonna do now?
Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefin with you
I think about tha game and what it's like AND WHAT WOULD IT BE WITHOUT YOU
You finished I ain't tryin' to repeat this just because I'm cool shouldn' take my kindness for weakness

(50 laughs: Oh shit)

(Busta speakin')
It was fun Next time you got a problem mate, Address me
Before you try to make tha shit a public issue homie, Now I'ma return back to my regular self
And have fun again

(50 Cent Outro)
