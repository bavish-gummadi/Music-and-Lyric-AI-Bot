Yo, I can't sing but I feel like singing
I want to fuckin' sing 'cause I'm happy yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back, yo, check it out

Somedays, I sit staring out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes, I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry

Sometimes, I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wasting my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly, I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes

'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

My baby girl keeps getting older, I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes 'cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side

I act like shit don't phase me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly, I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look in her eyes

Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't

Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'ma pistol packin' drug addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled
That hurts deep inside of my soul

And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?

Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, could have had someone else

But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin,3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman

Man, I should have seen it coming, what did I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore
(Hailey)

So sayonara, try tommorra, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you could get, the weight has been lifted

'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

Told you I can't sing, oh well, I tried, Hailey
Remember when I said, if you ever need anything
Daddy would be right there? Guess what?
Daddy's here and I ain't going nowhere, baby
I love you''''''''''''''''
