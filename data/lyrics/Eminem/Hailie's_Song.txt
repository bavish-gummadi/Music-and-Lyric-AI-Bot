Yo, I can't sing it.
I feel like singin'.
I wanna fuckin' sing.
'Cause I'm happy.
Yeah, I'm happy. (Haha)
I got my baby back.
Yo, check it out.

Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry

Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes

'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

My baby girl, keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, 'cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side

I act like shit don't phase me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes

'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

Man if I could sing I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't want her

Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul

And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world, and I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?

Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man it's too bad, coulda had someone else

But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to peoples backs, bent over backwards for this woman

Man I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't've ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie

So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted

Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin'on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

Woo! 
I told you I can't sing.
Oh well, I tried.
Hailie, 'member when I said "If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?"
Well guess what?
Daddy's here. And I ain't goin' nowhere baby.
I love you.''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
