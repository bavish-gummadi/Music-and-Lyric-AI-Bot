Slim shady is rock a bye bby
Shady is over never will rap again
If you want me too
You'll have to just leave me
There is one way you can actually complete me
Remember in mockingbird it was really sad
I tried to stop
But I was so mad trying to stop crying 'cause I couldn't see you no more then I got back to what was in store
I made my new choice
Can't help myself
I lo ve all of y'all and no body else
Shady is something
He is nothing I really can't help it 'cause he is nothing well seems like 1 and 2...
I wanns be with u

Nothing in this world is not above you
I love the way you smile
You do nice things
When I come back home

You're my everything
And everything is youwhen we stand close together
This is our stormy weather
I love the way you smile
I hate to play in 8 mile
Teach me how to love you better
So this could be a nice sunny weather
I love how you feel
And I know you keep it real
I'm furreal that I love you this is between 1 and 2
