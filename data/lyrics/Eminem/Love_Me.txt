[Obie Trice] 
You don't see me in the hood
It's 'cause I'm doing this man 

[Obie Trice] 
Niggas I'm still grindin' (yeah...)
I'm still hearin' those sirens 
I'm still getting chased by those lights 
Only the lights lime and my mic's on 
And my time is none because I'm writing more

And I ain't here to meet a soul in this buisness 
I'm here to eat, speak until these hoes feel this (for sure...) 
And I can't let y'all derail me man 
I got young Kobe hommie, you gotta let go of Obie 

'Cause Obie be back, (ain't goin' nowhere man...) 
We got them craps going on and that yak going on 
Soon as a nigga touch down back from tourin' 
It's whatever, put that on the chedda man

But in the meantime it's Jimmy Ivean time 
Chase cheese, rhyme till my voice give out 
This is i,t my nigga's, this is what we boast about 
Now I'm here, so shut your muthafuckin' mouth 
And show me love bitch 

I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
(I don't love you bitch)
I wanna hold you in the morning (ha)
Hold you through the night (hahaha)

I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
(We wanna love alcohol, we wanna love guns, we wanna love money)
I wanna hold you in the morning 
Hold you through the night...(Ha) (we don't wanna love bitches though) 

[Eminem] 
There's a certain mystique when I speak 
That you notice that's sorta unique
'cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat 
You can't sit still, its like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep

I'm strapped
Just knowin' any minute I could snap 
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped 
I bully these rappers so bad, lyrically 
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, its cock-a-many 
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady 
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's cuckoo 
I got screws loose, yeah the whole kit 'n' kaboodle 
I'm just brutal

It's no rumour, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humour in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
You better love me, bitch

I just wanna love you for the rest of my life 
I wanna hold you in the morning, 
Hold you through the night 

[Obie Trice]
And all the bitches say

I just wanna love you for the rest of my life 
I wanna hold you in the morning, 
Hold you through the night

[50 Cent] 
My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holler my name 
If it ain't about the flow
It's about the stones and the chain 
If I was you, I'd love me too
I roll like a bus, 9/11 Porche same colour as cranberry sauce 
I ain't gonna front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit 
Then we find out he fuckin' round with Bow Wow bitch

Niggas eatin' popcorn, right, rewindin' the tape 
Now Shorty, Momma in the precinct, hollerin' rape 
I'm convinced man, somethin' really wrong with these hoes 
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, then she start fuckin with her nose (God Damn) 
Used to listen to Lauren Hill and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD that didn't have no beats (uh-huh)

That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass for his record to sell
My back shot help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big Ben taught Charli B'more to deep throat
Yea'

I just wanna love you for the rest of my life 
I wanna hold you in the morning
(I luv'a burnish the monies, the bunnies, I just wanna hold you)
Hold you through the night

I just wanna love you for the rest of my life 
I wanna hold you in the morning (I just wanna love you)
Hold you through the night
Yeah''''''''''''''''''''
