And you know but actin' like you don't know

(Verse 1 ] [ 50 cent)

Now homie I say I run it run it 'cause I'm in control
Hypnotic, hennessey, a couple shots of patrone
I have you feelin' the hype, I get you high as a kite
Party poppin' shorty said she's comin' with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin' [Oh!]
I'm a hustler I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga you front you gon' get it, ok now maybe I said it
'Cause I want you triddip, yeah I be on that shiddit
You should see when I'm stuntin' I flash the stones that be wantin' (haha!)
Push the whip see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin'
I'm just doin' my thang, you know the units the gang
I got my grimey shady with me you front you'll have to get me
Off your ass (yeah!), I pay the lawsuit and laugh (haha!)
It's not a big deal it's nuttin' but some cash... [bring the hook back!]

Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know

This flow is gon' bring more dough [yeah!]
And you know but actin' like you don't know

(Verse 2 ] [ Eminem)

When me and fif got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemisis is su nemisis
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images [come on!]
But this shit is new gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out (whoooo!)
When it's beef you jus' gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, we don't resolve it
It just usually jus' evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it [yeah!]
We should all get a merit, as much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So it's shady after-mizz-ath back in that ass, you izz-ass [yeah... Come on!]
Come izzon what kinda fizz-uckin' question is that

Who run it? [you know, you actin' like you don't know]
I tear the club up fo' sho
(This flow is gon' bring more dough)
And you know but actin' like you don't know
Who run it? [i said you know, you actin' like you don't know]
I tear the club up fo' sho
(This flow is gon' bring more dough)
And you know but actin' like you don't know {cashis, break it down now!}

(Verse 3 ] [ Cashis)

Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin', JFK
HK to your chest plate
Cave out and ride till the death, do you rep that way
Forever I'ma be a shady 7-4 gangster
Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
I thrived off-a danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me... [Banks!]

(Verse 4 ] [ Lloyd banks)

Enough holdin' back the steam (uh), Em let off a magazine
Dappadon cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams (yeah)
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin' g [uh huh!]
I'ma hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet [oh!]
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it... [come on!]

We run it! You know, you actin' like you don't know [whoa!]
I tear the club up fo' sho [fo' sho!]
This flow is gon' bring more dough [more dough!]
And you know but you actin' like you don't know [don't know!]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know [yeah!]
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
And you know but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it?

(Outro ] [ Tony Yayo)
