If heartaches brought fame in love's crazy game,
I'd be a legend in my time.
If they gave gold statuettes for tears and regrets,
I'd be a legend in my time.

But they don't give awards, and there's no praise or fame
For a broken heart that's been broken over love that's in vain.

If loneliness meant world acclaim,
Then everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time.''''''''''''''''
