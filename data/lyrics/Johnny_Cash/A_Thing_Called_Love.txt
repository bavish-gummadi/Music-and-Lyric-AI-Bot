Six foot six he stood on the ground, 
He weighed 235 pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love

He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love

You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind that covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of every man, this thing called love
It can lift you up, never let you down
Take your world and turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger than love

Most men are like me, they worry and doubt
They trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with livin' to worry about a little word like love

But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I thank God that the world's been blessed with the thing called love

You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind that covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of every man, this thing called love
It can lift you up, never let you down
Take your world and turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger than love''''''''''''''''''
