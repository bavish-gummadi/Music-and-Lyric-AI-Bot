Everybody gonna have religion and glory
Everybody gonna be singin' a story
Everybody gonna have a wonderful time up there
(Oh, glory hallelujah)

Brother, there's a reckonin' a-comin' in the mornin'
And you better get you ready 'cause I'm givin' you the warnin'
Everybody wanna have a wonderful time up there
(Wonderful time up there)

Well, now you listen, everybody, 'cause I'm talkin' to you
Jesus is the only one can carry you through
Better get you ready 'cause I'm tellin' you why
My Lord is a-comin' from His home on high

Goin' down the valley, goin' one by one
Gonna be rewarded for the things we've done
How you gonna feel about the things you say
On that judgment day? Let me tell you 'bout it

Everybody gonna have religion and glory
Everybody gonna be singin' a story
Everybody gonna have a wonderful time up there
(Oh, glory hallelujah)

Brother, there's a reckonin' a-comin' in the mornin'
Better get you ready 'cause I'm givin' you the warnin'
Everybody gonna have a wonderful time up there
(Wonderful time up there)

Well, now you listen, hey, my sister, I'm not leavin' you out
You may not be a preacher but you sing and you shout
You'd feel better if you get redeemed, you know
Heaven's even better than a miser's dream

Think of the trouble you can save some soul
Show them how to reach the shining goal
You can teach somebody how to find the light
Make the whole thing right, yes

Everybody gonna have religion and glory
Everybody gonna be singin' the story
Everybody's gonna have a wonderful time up there
(Oh, glory hallelujah)

Brother, there's a reckonin' a-comin' in the mornin'
And you better get you ready 'cause I'm givin' you the warnin'
Everybody's gonna have a wonderful time up there
(Wonderful time up there)''''''''''''''''
