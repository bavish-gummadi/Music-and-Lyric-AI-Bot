I'm gonna go down on the creek bank, gather all my people
Pitch horseshoes until the sun goes down
Gonna barbecue my ribs, eat potato salad
Let the bird dogs run, let the children sing
Lord we're gonna get down

Yes, we shall gather down in Dixie
Where my father and my children's feet have trod
We shall all sing "Hallelujah"
I'm American by birth, and Southern by the grace of God

I'm gonna slip off with my cousin
For a little shot of bourbon
Listen to him stretch the truth for a little while
I'm gonna sneak up behind my baby
And tell her that I love her
I'm gonna lay her down in a hickory sheet
And watch my baby smile

Yes, we shall gather down in Dixie
Where my father and my children's feet have trod
We shall all sing "Hallelujah"
I'm American by birth, and Southern by the grace of God

Yes, we shall gather down in Dixie
Where my father and my children's feet have trod
We shall all sing "Hallelujah"
I'm American by birth, and Southern by the grace of God''''''''''''''''''
