Some men were born in poverty some were born with wealth
I was born a lovin' man and I just can't help myself
The women have all made over this old boy ever since I was born
That's why these old Arkansas travelin' shoes are so well worn

I've made quite a name for myself the girls know who I am
I'm a natural actual real authentical Arkansas lovin' man yes I am
Now in every little town that I've been in the story is the same
The girls all keep on a hangin' around playin' them lovin' games

But sometimes I wish them women folks would leave this old boy alone
I've thought about catchin' that next Greyhound back to my Arkansas home
But there ain't no use in kiddin' myself I like the way I am
I'm a natural actual real authentical Arkansas lovin' man

Oh yes I am
Now you look here woman that look in your eyes says maybe you love me so
But if you turn loose of my coatail I'll get my bedroll and go
'Cause I ain't nowhere near the kind of a fella that'll settle down
I've got a natural talent for lovin' and I'm gonna spread it around

If I ever come back your way again remember who I am
I'm a natural actual real authentical Arkansas lovin' man
I'm a natural actual real authentical Arkansas lovin' man yes I am'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
