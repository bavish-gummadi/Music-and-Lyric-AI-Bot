Ha ha ha, come on, bad news, ha ha ha
Well, bad news travels like wildfire
Good news travels slow 
They all call me 'Wildfire', ha ha
'Cause everybody knows 
I'm bad news everywhere I go, ha ha
Always gettin' in a trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go

They tried to hang me in Oakland and they did in Francisco
But I wouldn't choke, I broke their rope and they had to let me go

'Cause I'm bad news everywhere I go
Always gettin' in a trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go 

Now from north to south, east to west the story is the same
From one state to another I have to change my name 
'Cause I'm bad news everywhere I go
Always gettin' in a trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go 

Well now I've picked peaches in Georgia I lumberjacked in Maine 
I've been hired fired and jailed in any town you can name 
'Cause I'm bad news everywhere I go 
Always gettin' in a trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go''''''''''''''''''''
