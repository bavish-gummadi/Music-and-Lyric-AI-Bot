I asked my love to take a walk
Just a little ways with me
And as we walked and we would talk
All about our weddingday

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

I asked her if she'd marry me
And my wife forever be
She only turned her head away
And had no other words to say

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

I plunged a knife into her breast
And told her she was going to rest
She cried "Oh Willy, don't murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity."

I took her by her golden curls
I drug her down to the river-side
An I there threw her into drown
And I watched her as she floated down

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

And going home between twelve and one
I cried "Lord, what have I've done?"
I've killed the girl I love
Because she would not marry me

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio''''''''''''''
