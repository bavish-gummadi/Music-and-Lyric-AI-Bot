Ordained for proclaimin' the gospel of Jesus
The great super preachers go crusadin' on
And the people all gather in big congregations
They hear of the Saviour who came to atone
And they kneel at the altar and they walk away happy
Then the devil starts gossip about money and sex
Makin' it hard on the good men of God like Billy and Bob and Oral and Rex
Old Billy Sunday is dead and gone young Jim Robertson's comin' on strong
And Billy and Rex and Oral and Bob are talkin' about Jesus and doin' their job

Millions of people tune in Katherine Coolman
And see her face shine with an unearthly light
Garner Ted warns of the world of tomorrow
But they criticized him and the reverend died
'Cause the devil is after the great super preachers
He'd try to discredit the gospel they bring
But Billy and Rex and Oral and Bob hold to their commitment to Jesus the King
Old Billy Sunday is dead and gone young Tommy Barnett is comin' on strong
And Billy and Rex and Oral and Rex are talkin' about Jesus and doin' their job
Old Billy Sunday is dead and gone young Jimmy Snow is comin' on strong
And Billy and Rex and Oral and Bob are talkin' about Jesus and doin' their job''''''''''''''''''
