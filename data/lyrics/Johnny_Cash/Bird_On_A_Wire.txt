Like a bird on a wire 
Like a drunk in a midnight choir 
I have tried in my way to be free 

Like a fish on a hook 
Like a knight in some old fashioned book 
I have saved all my ribbons for thee

And if I have been unkind 
I hope that you will just let it go by 
And if I have been untrue 
I hope you know it was never to you

Like a baby stillborn Like a beast with his horn I have torn everyone who reached out to me

But I swear by this song 
And by all that I have done wrong 
I'll make it all up to you

I saw a young man leaning on his wooden crutch 
He called out to me "Don't ask for so much " And a young woman leaning on her darkened door 
She cried out to me "Why not ask for more"

Like a bird on a wire 
Like a drunk in a midnight choir 
I have tried in my way to be free''''''''''''''''
