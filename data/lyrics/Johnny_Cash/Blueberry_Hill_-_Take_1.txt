I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry hill when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered until my dreams came true

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be

Tho' we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill''''''''''''''''
