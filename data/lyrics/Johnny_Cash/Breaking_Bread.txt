Breaking Bread, Breaking Bread
We are gathered here together to break bread
Breaking Bread, Breaking Bread
We are gathered here together to break bread

It's not the barley or the wheat
It's not the oven or the heat
That makes this bread so good to eat
It's the needing and the sharing that makes the meal complete

Breaking Bread, breaking bread
We are gathered here together to break bread
Breaking Bread, breaking Bread
We are gathered here together to break bread

Upon the water prayed his cast
The last is first, the first is last
For everyone who eats this bread
There are thousands maybe more that will be fed

Breaking Bread, breaking bread
We are gathered here together to break bread
Breaking Bread, breaking Bread
We are gathered here together to break bread''''''''''''''''
