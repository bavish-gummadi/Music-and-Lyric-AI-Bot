Field of diamonds in the sky
Worlds are whirling right on by
Are you wondering who am i
Field of diamonds in the sky

Am I just a star in some crown
Or someone's life sun going down, down, down

Field of diamonds in the sky
Silent beauty shining high
Are you tears the angels cry
Field of diamonds in the sky

Field of diamonds in the sky
Like the night you pass me by
I could touch you if I try
Field of diamonds in the sky

Am I just a star in some crown
Or someone's life sun going down, down, down

Field of diamonds in the sky
Silent beauty shining high
Are you tears the angels cry
Field of diamonds in the sky''''''''''''''''''
