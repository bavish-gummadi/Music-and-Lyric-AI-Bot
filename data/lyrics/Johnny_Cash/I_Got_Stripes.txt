Johnny Cash:
On a Monday, I was arrested (yeah)
On a Tuesday, they locked me in the jail (oh, boy)
On a Wednesday, my trial was attested
On a Thursday, they said guilty
And the Judge's gavel fell

Both:
I got stripes: stripes around my shoulders
I got chains: chains around my feet
I got stripes: stripes around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains
They're 'bout to drag us down

George Jones:
On a Monday, I got my stripy britches
And on a Tuesday, I got my ball and chain
And on a Wednesday, I'm a-workin' diggin' ditches
On a Thursday, John
I begged them not to knock me down again

Both:
I got stripes: stripes around my shoulders
I got chains: chains around my feet
I got stripes: stripes around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains
They're 'bout to drag us down

Johnny Cash:
On a Monday, my momma come to see me (aww)
On a Tuesday, they caught me with a file
George Jones:
On a Wednesday, I'm down in solitary
And on a Thursday, John
I start on bread and water for a while

Both:
I got stripes: stripes around my shoulders
I got chains: chains around my feet
I got stripes: stripes around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains
They're 'bout to drag us down''''''''''''''''''''''
