Well, it's been rough and rocky travelin'
But I'm finally standin' upright on the ground
And after takin' several readings
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound

I thought Nashville was the roughest
But I know I've said the same about them all
We received our education
In the cities of the nation, me and Paul

Almost busted in Laredo
But for reasons that I'd rather not disclose
But if you're stayin' in a motel there and leave
Just don't leave nothin' in your clothes

And at the airport in Milwaukee
They refused to let us board the plane at all
They said we looked suspicious
But I believe they like to pick on me and Paul

And on a package show in Buffalo
With us some Kitty Wells and Charlie Pride
The show was long and we were just sittin' there
And we'd come to play and not just for the ride

And we drank a lot of whiskey
So I don't know if we went on that night at all
But I don't think they even missed us
I guess Buffalo ain't geared for me and Paul

Well, it's been rough and rocky travelin'
But I'm finally standin' upright on the ground
And after takin' several readings
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound

I thought Nashville was the roughest
But I know I've said the same about them all
We received our education
In the cities of the nation, me and Paul''''''''&''''&''''''
