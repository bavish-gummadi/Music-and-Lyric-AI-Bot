I have been ungrateful And I have been unwise
Restless from the cradle But now I realize
It's so hard to see the rainbow
Through glasses dark as these
Maybe I'll be able From down on my knees

Oh I am weak Oh I know I am vain
Take this weight from me
Let my spirit be unchained

Old man swearin' at the sidewalk
And I am overcome Seems that we've both forgotten
Forgotten to go home

Have I seen an angel
Or have I seen a ghost
Where's that rock of ages
When you need it most

It's so hard to see the rainbow
Through glasses dark as these
Maybe I'll be able From down on my knees''''''''&''''&''''''
