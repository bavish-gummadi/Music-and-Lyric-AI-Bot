Come on honey don't you treat me wrong 
Come and love your daddy all night long 
Hey hey all right 
Hey hey baby what'd I say 

See that girl with a diamond ring 
I know where she got that thing 
Hey hey all right 
Hey hey baby what'd I say 

Oh yeah honey you're so fine 
Baby you're so fine 
Honey you're so fine 
Honey you're so fine 
Oh you're so fine hey hey all right 
Hey hey baby what's I say 

See the gal with the rich dress on 
She can do that all night long 
Hey hey all right 
Hey hey baby what'd I say 

When you see me in misery 
Come on baby and stand by me 
Hey hey all right 
Hey hey baby what'd I say 
Baby what'd I say right now 
What'd I say right now 
Honey you're so fine'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
