It takes a worried man to sing worried song
It takes a worried man to sing worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long

I went across the river, and I lay down to sleep
I went across the river, and I lay down to sleep
When I woke up, had shackles on my feet

Twenty nine links of chain around my leg
Twenty nine links of chain around my leg
And on each link, the initial of my name

It takes a worried man to sing worried song
It takes a worried man to sing worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long

I asked that judge, tell me, what might be my fine
I asked that judge, tell me, what might be my fine
Twenty one years on the R C Mountain line

The train arrived, sixteen coaches long
The train arrived, sixteen coaches long
The girl I love is on that train and gone

It takes a worried man to sing worried song
It takes a worried man to sing worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long

If anyone asks you who composed this song
If anyone asks you who composed this song
Tell 'em t'was I, and I sing it all day long

It takes a worried man to sing worried song
It takes a worried man to sing worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long''''''''&''''&''''''
