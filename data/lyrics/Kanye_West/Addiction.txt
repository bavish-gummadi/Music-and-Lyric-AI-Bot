Etta James:
You make me smile in my heart, oh

Kanye West and Etta James:
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)

Kanye West:
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja, Henny and Coca-Cola
Then I'm co coming over 'cause it's never over

Kanye West and Etta James:

But (You make me smile)

Kanye West:
I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blown
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and Coca-Cola
And I keep co coming over 'cause it's never over

Kanye West and Etta James:
I just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to um, let me, how would I put this uh
Let's say all your friends, remember the one
You said if you ever she would be the one
OK, OK, OK (You make me smile with my heart, oh)
I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean don't take this seriously
Don't take me, I mean just, uh, not credibly
I'm feeling incredibly, I mean let it be
I just let it be, I mean you, her and me (You make me smile with my heart, oh)
I mean you, her and me
Maybe, baby, baby
Baby, baby
You know I was just kidding
Unless you gon' do it (You make me smile)''''''''''''''''''
