Syleena Johnson and Kanye West:
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Yeah, this the real one baby)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (Chi-Town stand up)
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Southside, southside, we gon' set this party off right)
I'm telling you all, it all falls down (Westside, westside, we 'gon set this party off right)
Oh when it all

Kanye West:
Man I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a career
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair"
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
'Cause her baby-daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

Syleena Johnson and Kanye West:
Oh when it all, it all falls down
(And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon)
(And when it falls down) Oh when it all

Kanye West:
Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see
Then I spent four-hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga you ain't up on this"
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

Syleena Johnson and Kanye West:
Oh when it all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon)
(And when it falls down who you gonna call now?)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon)
(And when it falls down) Oh when it all

Kanye West:
I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We-a buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorties holler, "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with twenty-five thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
'Cause I want to be on 106 and Park pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

Syleena Johnson and Kanye West:
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Yeah, c'mon, c'mon)
(And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon
(And when it falls down)

Oh when it all, it all falls down (Southside, southside, we gon' set this party off right)
I'm telling you all, it all falls down (Westside, westside, we gon' set this party off right)
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Chi-Town, Chi-Town, we gon' show 'em how we get down)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (Now Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life)
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

DeRay Davis:
I's can't keep working like this
This grave shift is like a slave shift''''''''''''''''''
