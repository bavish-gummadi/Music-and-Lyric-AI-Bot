It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in
No matter what you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see, it's amazing

So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing

I'm a monster I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong, yeah
I'm a problem
That will never ever be solved
No matter what you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see, it's amazing

So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing

I'm a monster I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave in never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of
No matter what you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see, its amazing

So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing

Young Jeezy:
I'm amazing, yeah I'm all that
If I ain't on my grind then what you call that?
Victorious, yeah we warriors
We make history, strive off victory
Standing at my podium I'm trying to watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure either let the feds catch ya
I'm amazing born on a full moon
I was bred to get it in, no spoon
That's why I'm so goose summertime no juice
Big family, small house, no rooms
They like, "Oh god why he go so hard
Look what he's been through, he deserves an applause"

Kanye West:
