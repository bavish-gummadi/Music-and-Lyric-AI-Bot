It's amazing, I'm the reason everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing, holding on to what I believe in
No matter what you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
(Let's go)

I'm a monster, I'm a killer, I know I'm wrong, yeah
I'm a problem that'll never ever be solved
And no matter what you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
(Let's go)

I'm a monster, I'm a maven, I know this world is changin'
Never gave in, never gave up, I'm the only thing I'm afraid of
No matter what you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'

I'm amazin', yeah I'm all that
If I ain't on my grind then what you call that?
Victorious, yeah we warriors
We make history, strive of victory

Standing at my podium I'm trying watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure, you even let the feds getcha
I'm amazin' born on the full moon
I was bred to get in, no spoon

That's why I'm so goose, summer time, no juice
Big family, small house, no rooms
They like, oh God why you go so hard?
Look what he's been through, he deserves an applause

So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'''''''''''''''''
