For my theme song (Black)
My leather black jeans on (Black)
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on (Black)
Enter the kingdom (Black)
But watch who you bring home
They see a Black man with a White woman
At the top floor they gon' come to kill King Kong

Middle America packed in (Black)
Came to see me in my black skin (Black)
Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin' (Black)
If I don't get ran out by Catholics (Black)
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin' 
Lke them Black kids in Chiraq, bitch

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it three hundred, like the Romans
Three hundred bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
And you know it, and you know it
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doing five hundred, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I woulda been blacked out on your ass

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it three hundred, like the Romans
Three hundred bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
And you know it, and you know it
And you know it, and you know it

Stop all that coon shit (Black)
Early morning cartoon shit (Black)
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb, bitch (Black)
Black out the room, bitch (Black)
Stop all that coon shit (Black)
These niggas ain't doin' shit (Black)
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on, homie, what happened
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready, ready for action, action

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it three hundred, like the Romans
Three hundred bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
And you know it, and you know it
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doing five hundred, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I woulda been blacked out on your ass
