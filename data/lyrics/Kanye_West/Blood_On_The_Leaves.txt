Nina Simone:
Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

Kanye West and Nina Simone:
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime (Breeze)
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now (Breeze)
And all I want is what I can't buy now (Blood on the leaves)
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait (Breeze)
Yeah, I told you to wait (Breeze)
So I'mma need a little more time now (Blood on the leaves)
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait (Breeze)
Yeah, I thought you could wait (Breeze)
These bitches surroundin' me (Black bodies)
All want something out me (Hangin' in the summer breeze)
Then they talk about me (Breeze)
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody (Strange fruit)
Thought you'd be different 'bout it (Hangin')
Now I know you not it (From the poplar trees)
So let's get on with it (From the poplar trees)

We could've been somebody
'Stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves (Black bodies hangin' in the summer breeze, breeze)
I know there ain't wrong with me (Strange fruit hangin')
Something strange is happenin' (From the poplar trees)
(From the poplar trees)

Kanye West:
You could've been somebody
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia

Kanye West and Nina Simone:
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas (Black bodies)
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas (Hangin' in the summer breeze)
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas (Breeze)
I ride with my niggas, I'd die for my
(From the poplar trees)
(From the poplar trees)

Kanye West:
To all my second string bitches, try and get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyonc, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That goin' to that owin' money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh, yeah-yeah, she got you homie, yeah
Till death but do your part, uh, unholy matrimony

Nina Simone:
Black bodies hangin' in the summer breeze, breeze
Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees

Kanye West and Nina Simone:
That summer night holdin' long and long (Breeze), 'din long (Breeze)
Now waiting (Blood on the leaves) for the summer rose and (Breeze)
And breathe and breathe (Blood on the leaves)
And breathe and breathe (Breeze, breeze)
And breathe and breathe (Black bodies hangin' in the summer breeze)
And live and learn (Breeze)
And live and learn (Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees)
And livin' and livin' like I'm lonely, lonely, lonely (From the poplar trees, from the poplar trees)
And livin' all I have
And livin' all (Breeze, breeze)
And live (Blood on the leaves)
And live (Breeze, breeze)
(Blood on the leaves)
(Breeze, breeze)''''''''''''''''''''''
