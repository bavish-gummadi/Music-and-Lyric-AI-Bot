Let me call some call some girls that I know, know
I don't mean them Bougie ones from befo', fo'
I need some girls that's really down to get low, low

Now if my man Benzino got a Benz then they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley they gon' call me Bentlino
A lot of shit changed since I hooked up with Jay-Z yo
For the track charged about 800 see Notes
So glad I ain't take the job at Home Depo
Right now my car and home would be repoed
Broke up with my girl today around three-o
My man said let's call some girls that we know, oh
Sometimes I wanna say fuck my bitch
But I don't want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin' chick suck my dick
It wouldn't make me not feel so sick
Just because they came over to cheer me up
Smoke, drink, and yeah we fuck
No matter what they do it could be enough

Lookie here holmes gettin' my stunt on
I step in the bar I'm a superstar
They know who I are from the pimp description
Mack ho's just to get 'em in the doggy position
Put my key in yo ignition work the kitten
Introduce you to how hustlas livin'
Pickin' bubble gum is all I'm givin'
New whip, new gear, new brick to sit in
I'll take ya bitch, make ya bitch make me rich
For major chips, for now you sick
Stat Quo got dough to blow, and drow to blow
Yak to sip and wigs to split
'Nuff grip, won't slip be easy
Yo girlfriend wants to please me
Make a porno, put her on TV
Make the pussy drip drip when she see me

Go get a bigger scale, on a scale of one to six
I'm an eleven, you're in heaven when I punish it
I got her naked but I knew I wasn't gonna hit
'Cause she was lookin' at it like 'That isn't gonna fit'
I told her I was only gonna use half of it
You want a smaller size, go and rent a plastic dick
Why you actin' like you a genital activist?
Matter fact, you can get out, you can pack ya shit
She was like 'Ey! Why you gotta act like this?'
Cause you waistin my time and you can ask my wrist
Now you tryna talk to me about abstinence
And she was like wait a second let me ask ya this
Is ya name Chamillionaire? Do you rap? (No)
Ain't you on that song with Kanye West and Stat Quo?
Ron see siad you was (Oh, is that so?)
Then I said I don't know what he told you that fo'
Picked up the phone, I'm like''''''''''''''''
