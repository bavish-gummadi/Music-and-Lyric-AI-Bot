(Feat. Young Jeezy)

Kanye (Jeezy):
La La La La (Yeah)
Wait till I get my money right

(Verse 1: Young Jeezy)
Snowman Bitch (Bitch), Need I say More? (More?)
When you get done wit these, look I got twenty more (Ha Ha!)
Still got blow money cause nigga I know money (Money)
Now I'm on the road gettin' fifty-a-show money
Still sittin' on white bricks (Bricks), wrapped in duck tape (Tape)
Thirty minutes flat, I can bake a whole cake (Yeah!)
Got a pocket full of stacks, safe full of blocks (Blocks)
Then they come through, look at the stones on the watch (Geah!)
Iced-out belt buckle, they never had a chance
Dropped sixty-grand, just to hold up my pants (Ha Ha!)
Still got the chevy, spent a grip on the Lambo
Twelve carats in my ear just to show 'em what I stand fo' (Aye!)

La laa lala wait till I get my money right
La laa lala then you can't tell me nothing right

(Chorus: Kanye (Jeezy))
La La La La (HEY)
Wait till I get my money right
La La La La (Yeah)
Then you can't tell me nothing right (Why are we... late)
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing (Yeah)
You can't tell me nothing (HAHA)
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

(Verse 2: Kanye West)
Let the champaigne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get pass (Oh oh oh oh oh)
You don't needa stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off the fumes cause (Why are we... late)
How you move in a room full of nose?
How you stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharoahs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, HUH, depending how you dress her (Oh oh oh oh oh)
So if the devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher (Why are we... late)
But way less effort, 'cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Ya homies looking like "Why God?"
When they reminice over you my God

(Chorus: Kanye (Jeezy))
La La La La (HEY)
Wait till I get my money right
La La La La (Yeah)
Then you can't tell me nothing right (Why are we... late)
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing (Yeah)
You can't tell me nothing (HAHA)
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing''''''''''''''''''''''''
