Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab your ass.

Why you actin' all
Shy and all
Why is y'all
Lyin' for?
"I never did this before..."
Stop that
What you want some petron?
I got that.
I mean I promise y'all
You fine and all
And your girlfriend, she kinda raw
But she not like you
No, she not like you
Right now I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talkin' is gon' give me a tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of y'all
Right now the Louis Vuitton Don is signing off
But I just thought we should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris and some Mo
And we about to let it flow
Had some problems before but see we let 'em go
Got an ounce of that dro
And we about to let it blow.

Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that, I grab your ass.

See you know my style
I'm very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that you had a phatty
He looked up at me said "Daddy that's the reason why you had me?"
Yep, we was praticing
Till one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though? You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal
For my newborn child cause now y'all...

Know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab your ass.
But I just thought we should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris and some Mo
And we about to let it flow
Had some problems before but see we let 'em go
Got an ounce of that dro
And we about to let it blow.

Hoe! Hoe!
We lookin' for some
Hoe! Hoe! Hoe!''''''''''''''''''
