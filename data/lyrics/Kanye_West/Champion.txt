Donald Fagen:
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Kanye West:
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin', show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mmm hmm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

Donald Fagen:
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Kanye West:
You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted, layaway or a deposit
My daddy'd say, "When you see clothes, close your eyelids"
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school wit' a new wardrobe

Donald Fagen and Kanye West:
(And hey, hey, hey, hey)
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Kanye West:
I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin' show you how we lived
Everything I wanted man it seemed so serious
Mmm hmm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

Donald Fagen:
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Kanye West:
When it feel like living's harder than dying
For me giving up's way harder than trying
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhyming
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week, I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keeping kids in the school
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do
If not for pleasure, then at least for the principle
They got the CD, they got to see me
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

Donald Fagen and Kanye West:
(Hey, hey, hey)
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Connie Mitchell:
This is the story of a champion
Runners on your mark and they pop the guns
Stand up, stand up, here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one
This is the story of a champion
Runners on your mark and they pop the guns
Stand up, stand up, here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one
Tell me what it takes to be number one
