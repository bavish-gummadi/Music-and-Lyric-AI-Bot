[Sample] (Kanye)
And now for my next number,
I'd like to return to the cl-
To the cl-
To the classics (Classics)
(Timeless)
(Classic)
(I'm better than I've ever been, timeless)
Rakim, the fiend of the microphone

(Rakim)
Is y'all ready for Twenty-0-7, it's now another drought
Everyone's a killer, wow we buggin' out
Since '86 showin' the crowd what I'm about
And they still want to know when the album comin' out
Ask the teenagers, OGs and ask the kids
What they definition of classic is
Timeless, so age don't count in the booth
When your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth
Ain't no doubtin' the truth I'm off the meters
Everybody co-signing even non-believers
Since I came in the door, became one of y'alls leaders
In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers
Uptown we call 'em uppies when they on divas
Prolly want what KRS-One teaches
Nas, made you look, before the haters
I bet you Kan had 'em on when he walked with Jesus
This is

Classic
I'm better than I've ever been
Timeless
I'm everywhere you've never been and better than I've ever been
Classic
I'm better than I've ever been
Timeless
(I-I-I'd like to return to the classics)

(Kanye West)
Kan-Kanye West
Can't buy this, superflyness, like a shyness, your highness
It's performin', look how long the line is
That's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
That's what happens these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?
That's so novice, I'm so polished
I got a right to be a little bit snobbish
I did a little bit of college
Semesters it took 2 like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place
The beat slowed till you listened to my pace
'Cause I be killin' shit, but that's evident
And y'all feelin' it, but I expected it
If it's classic it's gonna last forever than I'm everywhere you never been and better than I ever been

Classic
I'm better than I've ever been
Timeless
I'm everywhere you've never been and better than I've ever been
Classic
I'm better than I've ever been
Timeless
(All of 4th town represent to the fullest Nas and Rockwell)

Nas:
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper
To them it hurts to hear this
Oh you went platinum - yeah that's nice
Now let me see you do the same thing twice
3 times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times
Please your amateur night is show time
It's one life to live so live it the best you can
The world could use one less man
Not enough air
Not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain't right
By the time you could afford it the car ain't important
In the streets silent, it's just I and - cops keep firin' (pow, pow, pow) in my environment
Leavin' you slump when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager to jump on
I'd like to be the wall that they toast up on
I'd like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong
I'm classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that's what I'm accustomed to

Classic
I'm better than I've ever been
Timeless
I'm everywhere you've never been and better than I've ever been
Classic
I'm better than I've ever been
Timeless
(I-I-I'd like to return to the classics)

KRS-One:
(Of course we have, blast-master KRS-One)
How many y'all got criminal minded
You, you, you, y'all don't be blinded
Me, I got no jewels on my neck
Why? I don't need 'em I got your respect
KRS-One 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock this hip hop
And we's a nation, don't you want to hear more KRS on your radio station?
Instead of broadcasting how we smokin' trees
On the radio we need to hear more local MC's
Where you at? Come on where you at?
This is the difference between MC'ing and rap
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal
MC's spit rhymes to uplift they people
Peace, love, unity, havin' fun, these are the lyrics of KRS-One

Classic
I'm better than I've ever been
Timeless
I'm everywhere you've never been and better than I've ever been
Classic
I'm better than I've ever been
Timeless
(I-I-I'd like to return to the classics)''''''''''''''''
