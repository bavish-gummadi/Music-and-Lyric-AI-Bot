And this time it's all or nothing
(Set it real, oh yeah)

Show you how I put down with rocks, my lady
Promise you asking when I'm done for more
I'ma switch it up and make life comfortable

I'ma be the reason you're not sleeping baby
I'ma invade the thoughts you keeping maybe
If you're still not convinced, I'll tell you more
Make you forget the way you felt before
(Oh, oh)

I can be ya wake up reason daily
You can be my first and leading lady
I'ma make you happy that you waited
For me to settle down
(Oh, oh)

I'm ready and I'm not afraid to say it
I'm tired of the game, already played it
I'm over all 'em other girls I dated
I tell you what you are

You're my diamond girl

You're my diamond girl
You're the one that I quit the game for

Don't be shy 'bout how you feel

Burberry overcoat, new money attitude
A playboy you would know if you read the news
I could be with any other fine girl instead of you

Night life, city light, ride roof back
She's quite pretty nice, I'll choose that
I'll be your publisher, you could be my centerfold
Long as you do me right, show me how I'm edible

And I'm a lead man, you could be my co-star
You been acting like your mind's right so far
And you the type that enjoy the best
The 4 star suites, ice, big toys and jets for real

Let me show you how its' supposed to feel
Mommy take them shoes off, lets close the deal
'Cause sunny you reached the top, stop social climbing
If my record don't sell we'll still go diamond

You're my diamond girl
You're the one that I quit the game for

You're my diamond girl
