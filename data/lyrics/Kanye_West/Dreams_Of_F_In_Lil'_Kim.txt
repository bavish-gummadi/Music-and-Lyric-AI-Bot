(Kanye talking)

First of all this song right here got a long ass intro
You got everything you got beats from kanye
What else you need
This a this a kanye beat
It's not da it's not da imposters this time
You know you like this
I I know I I been in the studio with her
You know what listen to me

You'll never catch me in that baby mama bizz again
I'm pushin da g-5 all da girls tryna say my hair look Indian
And they ain't neva seen him and MC em
Now I don't like fake titties but ill fuck lil kim
Its just da weight datz been killin' me
I been waitin for hilary to leave da room to find out if she feelin' me
Sprinkle a little game tell her we tourin da same
She like a lotta clothes I like to see her out of em
She got a lot exsposed pump up the volume
Pump of the volume dance dance
Don't give kanye a chance
'Cause imma gemini with 2002 rides
Y'all talkin' that business I'm peepin the thighs
Look imma tryna hit dat back end before I get dat back end
Called g how do she need dat beat track again and tell her

I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin
See I came back for you
'Cause any rap chick dat look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price

Back when eve went with steve
Before she had a weave
I was sendin her beat tapes like you wouldn't believe

Back when foxy had a group with nas and az
Da way she looked on chyna doll
I wouldve did dem beats for free
'Cause only recently I been gettin' a visa fee
Da checks I got from d dot was steady teasin me
I got some earrings he gave me they may be fake
But at least its got girls callin me babycake
Now maybe kay can have a manaj with lazy kay
And lady may maybe hey
You lookin' all thick and sweet
You need a n*gga that can give you dick and beats
So go and get angie and tell her

I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin
See I came back for you
'Cause any rap chick dat look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price

(Kanye talkin')

Right now I gotta 2 for head sale
Send send headshots first tho
Beat tapes for who
Oh trina I'm right there I'm right there
I'll be at the studio in five minutes
Yeah yeah she said she wanna ass look
Could she wear
I told her all I needed was my back end checked
I told her''''''''''''''''''''''''
