Mos Def:
Love the dangerous necessity that people seek without regard
To where they are, the human heart is curious, above all things
Love, the lights are low, your eyes are bright
The music plays, it's sweet delight
It's out of sight, I'm feeling right, your dress is tight
Oh how I want you right now
