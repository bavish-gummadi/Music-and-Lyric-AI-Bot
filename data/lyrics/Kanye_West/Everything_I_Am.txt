Kanye West and Chuck D:
Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

Kanye West:
I'll never be picture perfect Beyonc
Be light as Al B. or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet, he was as black as the street was
I never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played the big role in "Chicago" like Queen Latifah
I never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.Am
Let me know if you feel it man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

Kanye West and Chuck D:
Damn, here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

Kanye West:
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or Adidos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows?
So say goodbye to the N-double A-CP award
Goodbye to the India Arie award
They'd rather give me the ni-nigga-please award
But I'll just take the I-got-alotta-cheese award

Kanye West and Chuck D:
Damn, here we go again
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

Kanye West:
I know that people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets
Man, killing's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains, a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door 'cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
"That's enough Mr. West, please, no more today"

Kanye West and Chuck D:
Damn, here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

Chuck D:
Here we go, here, here we go
Here we go, here, here we go
Here we go, we, we, we
We go, we go, we go, we go, we go
Go go go again

Prince Philip Mitchell:
Yeah baby''''''''''''''''''
