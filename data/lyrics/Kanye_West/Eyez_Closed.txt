And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

Sippin' yak while I elevate my mind state
Hand by the burner in case a near try to violate
Never go down, stay rising like Andre
'Cause my corner back every thing the Don say
Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song
Err'y day, err'y night till I'm carried home
Forever known, big ballin', try it in the city
Then yelling out swish way before it in the net

And I ain't knockin' niggas hustle, it's all a game
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in betweens
We either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame
And you ain't got to wonder where my place at
Pepsi blue rags sorta poppin', bitch taste that
One hit of the bong will blow ya face back
LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

I do it 'cause I feel it
Live it like I'm talkin'
Flow so straight but won't a nigga try and walk it
I'm so high, yeah the weed, I'm still sparking it
My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling
Got the competition shaking like Parkinsons
Breads in the bag, call it good marketin'
Life's a bitch but I don't caught again
That's what a word to the third letter

Shot, shot, shots to me and my cheddar
Run these emcee's I'm tougher than leather
Vietnamese eyes tighter than ever
Fuck with the Dogg I'm biting whomever
'Cause I didn't came from a long path
Only God knows how long left the Dogg has
'Cause like time we all pass
So if you ever taste success, just pray it's from a tall glass

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
'Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness
Get away from me whack tracks

I can only make only hits
I'm an only child lost in the world
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell rings
Its feeling like hell rings
It's bringing me back down
He's checking my background
It's ironic what's happening
Imagine if I didn't have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends

I'm spaced out dog, I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain't finna change, so we won't agree again
Till then I'll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

(Repeat: x4)
See you with my eyes closed''''''''''''''''
