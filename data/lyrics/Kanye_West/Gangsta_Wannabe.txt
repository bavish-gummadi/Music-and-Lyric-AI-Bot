Kanye:
This song's for all the posers tryin' ta make out that they all bad an' shit
Man, y'all spread it so thick you could mulch my lawn
I don't claim to be a bad gangsta like y'all wannabes
Ya see, I'm just a regula nigga an I'm keepin' it real (Hey, Hey)

Mario:
I ain't no gangsta an' I ain't no thug
The F.B.I. ain't tryin'a lock me up
But if you keepin' it real, girl, I could be yo man
Got a heart fulla lovin' an a natural tan

Kanye: T's like dese cat's dat I see all be tryin' ta front
If ya see me on the block, I'm just out havin' fun
When I see a cop crusin' I don't take off on a run
Feel that bulge in my pocket, that's me, girl, tain't no shotgun

Mario:
I ain't no gangsta an' I ain't no thug
The F.B.I. ain't tryin'a lock me up
But if you keepin' it real, girl, I could be yo man
Got a heart fulla lovin' an a natural tan

Kanye:
My teeth ain't gold, dey a natural white
An' I'll defend myself, but I ain't lookin' ta fight
Some dudes say dey ballin', but that ain't me
I'm just a regular nigga, what you get's what you see


An I ain't droppin' me money like it's made outa piss
I don't bathe in champagne, man, that's ludacriz!
If ya come to da club, in the center you'll find me
Gettin' down with girls, not bodyguards, around me

Kulcha Don:
Dese foos wanna play dat dey sumptin dey not
Dey tink dey rep'd be bettah if dey sinned 'n' got caught
But I tink dey brains fried 'cause a life on de run
Can't compare wid bein crazy krunk 'n' out havin' fun

If you hear your door-a knockin' do you think it's de cops
Do you hide in your basement till dat bangin' stops?
Well my door's always open and de party is on
So forget all dem posers, bring your girls an come on

Kanye:
So if ya see me on de street, girl, just come up an' say 'hi'
'Cause I'm a whole lot crazy an' a lil' bit shy
Can you love a real boy? I ain't got no disguise
All I got is de love that ya see in dese eyes

Mario:
I ain't no gangsta an' I ain't no thug
The F.B.I. ain't tryin'a lock me up
But if you keepin' it real, girl, I could be yo man
Got a heart fulla lovin' an a natural tan''''''''''''''''
