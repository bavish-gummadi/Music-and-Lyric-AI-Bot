Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning

Wake up, Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mr. By-Himself-He's-So-Impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's, motherfucker D's, Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test
I guess this is my dissertation
Homie this shit is basic, welcome to graduation

Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning

Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from a eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang

Good morning
Good morning
Good morniying
Good morning

Good morniying, look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preachers, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stoled yo' streetness
After all of that you received this

Kanye West and Jay-Z:
Good morning
(Hustlers, that's if you're still livin', get on down)
Every time that we hear them, good morning
(Hustlers, that's if you're still livin', get on down)
Every time that we hear them, good morning
(Hustlers, that's if you're still livin', get on down)
Every time that we hear them, good morning
(Hustlers, that's if you're still livin', get on down)

Jay-Z:
Get on down
Get, get on down
Get on down
Get, get on down''''''''''''''''''
