What in the fuck was that Kanye? I told you to do some shit for the kids. 
You give me your muthafuckin' graduation ticket right now. 
You can give me this muthafuckin' robe 
You will not walk across that stage, you won't slide across that stage 
A muthafucker can't pull you across that muthafuckin' stage Kanye 
Who told you see, I told you to do something uplifting 
I'm tryin' to get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me 
You know what, you's a nigga 
And I don't mean that in no nice way 
Had little kids singin' about the shit, the joke's on you 
You can throw your muthafuckin' hands in the air, and wave good-bye to every-fuckin'-body 
Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus 
Fucker what you gone do now 

I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody. 
I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody. 
I got something better than school but don't tell anybody. 
My daddy would kill me so don't tell anybody. 
He wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody. 
He ain't walked in my shoes, I'm just not everybody.''''''''''''''''''
