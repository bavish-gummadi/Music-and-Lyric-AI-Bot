DeRay Davis:
Mr. West
Mr. West
Mr. West

Kanye West:
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah

And I heard 'em say
"Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allahu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it

Kanye West and Adam Levine:
Uh, and I heard 'em say
"Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
And I heard 'em say
"Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
But we'll a find a way
(And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way)

Kanye West:
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And gram keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

Kanye West and Adam Levine:
Uh, and I heard 'em say
"Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll a find a way
(And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way)

Adam Levine:
With every worthless word, we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
