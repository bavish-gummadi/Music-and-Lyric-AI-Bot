In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless, heartless
How could you be so heartless, heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me, yo
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless, heartless
How could you be so heartless, heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homey I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless, heartless
How could you be so heartless, heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight, into...

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless, heartless
How could you be so heartless, heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

(Heartless, heartless, heartless, heartless, heartless)
