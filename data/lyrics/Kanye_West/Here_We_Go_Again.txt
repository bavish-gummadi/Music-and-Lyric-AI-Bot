(Kanye West)
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it?
What people pay paper for damn it
They can't stand it, they want something new
So let's get re-acquainted
Became the hood favorite
I can't even explain it
I surprise myself too

Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on, with something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, here's another hit, Barry Bonds

(Hook - Kanye West)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
We outta here baby!
We outta here baby!
We outta here baby!

(Kanye West)
Dude!
Fresh off the plane, konitchiwa bitches
Turn around another plane, my passport on pimpin'
As for what I did, that nigga done did it
Talked it and he lived it, spitted then he shitted
I don't need to write hits, I might bounce ideas,
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year
They said he's going crazy and we seen this before
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Please, how you gonna say I ain't no low-head
'Cause my Dior got me more my dough-head
I'm insulted
You should go here
And bow so hard till your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MC's you ain't gotta remind me
Top 5 MC's you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you can get behind me


But my head's so big you can't sit behind me
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on, with something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, here's another hit, Barry Bonds

(Hook - Lil Wayne)
(Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Yeah, Yeah, We outta here baby!
Wha, Wha, We outta here baby!
And Mr. West is so outta here baby
And me, I'm Mr. Weezy Baby

(Lil Wayne)
I'm so bright not shady
My teeth and my eyes so wight like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
Whenever they make them, I shall hate them
Oops I meant have them, I'm so crazy
But if you get crazy you be sleeping with daisies
Its such a hay-bit, oops I meant habit
And my drink's still pinker than the easter rabbit
And I'm still cold (cole) like Keisha's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to baddies
And I ate it 'cause I'm so at it
I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice
And I don't lack shit
And you can get Barried

(Chorus - Kanye West)
We outta here baby
We outta here baby
We outta here baby

(Lil Wayne)
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on
Wit something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, man here's another hit, Barry Bonds

(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)''''''''''''''''
