Hey Mama, I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama
I know I act a fool but I promise you I'm goin' back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me
And I just want you to be proud of me.
Hey Mama.

I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm gonna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was 3 years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up somethin' that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that Mommy can't you see?
7 years old, I caught you with tears in your eyes
Cause a nigga cheatin' tellin' you lies then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said Mommy I'm a love you so you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'm a get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See your unbreakable unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you.

Hey Mama, I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama
I know I act a fool but I promise you I'm goin' back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me
And I just want you to be proud of me.
Hey Mama.

Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me "Go to school get your doctorate."
Somethin' to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was gettin' through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of "You Are So Beautiful To Me?"
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nicky Jovanni, turn 1 page and there's my Mommy
Come on Mommy just dance with me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say "Hey" y'all say "Mama" now everybody answer me.

Hey Mama, I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama
I know I act a fool but I promise you I'm goin' back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me
And I just want you to be proud of me.
Hey Mama.

I guess it also depends though, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let your friends know.
Hey Mama.

Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'm a get you a jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say "Hey Mama."

I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama.
You know I love you so and I never let you go
I wrote this song just so you know no matter where you go my love is true.
Hey Mama.
Hey Mama.
