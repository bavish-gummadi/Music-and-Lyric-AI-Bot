Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Whoa
Never leave me alooooooooone
Tell 'em holla at ya boy and 'cause I'll be comin' home
I'll be comin' home
Ooh, never leave me alooooooooone
Tell 'em holla at ya boy and 'cause I'll be comin' home
I'll be coming home


My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
It's been a whole lot of hatin' again
And if they hatin' on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I love most she had so much soul
She said excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me but uh my name is wendy (windy) and yo, I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tore 'em off
And make them straighten up they hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
And at nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said it feel like you walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me
But if you really cared for her
Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her it always seem like she talkin' 'bout me
She said you left ya kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you
And I just got through
Talkin' bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till is gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
In the interviews I'm representin you makin' you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds
Spark ya lighters and wave 'em around
If you don't know by now I'm talkin' about Chi-town


Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Whoa
Never leave me alooooooooone
Tell 'em holla at ya boy and 'cause I'll be comin' home
I'll be comin' home
Ooh, never leave me alooooooooone
Tell 'em holla at ya boy and 'cause I'll be comin' home
I'll be coming home''''''''''''''''
