Yeah Yeah
Class Heat

Yeah Baltimore Club Music
Yeah I'm The shit
I got them diamonds on my neck
Got Patron in my cup
If you wanna come and get it
Shawty I don't give a fuck
See it's Friday night
And I just got paid
I done had a hard week
Now it's time To Celebrate
Well the DJ played my shit
Some of that club music shit
Make the girls wanna freak
Back it all up on my dick
See it's on tonight
Trying to leave with something right
I'm a grown ass man
So Shawty you can spend the night

'Cause I'm the shit
Yeah I'm the shit
Up in this bitch
Up in this bitch
Yeah I'm the shit
Yeah I'm the shit
Up in this bitch
Up in this bitch

I got a crib down the hill
And we on Reistertown
Girl I'm hardly ever home
Because I'm always out of town
Is that your girlfriend
I really like her
Her booty's fat like yours
I really like her
I know the club is bout to close
But it's only 3 o'clock
They hating and they hating
'Cause I got this thing on lock
Why the two baddest bitches in the club
Going home with me

'Cause I'm the shit
Yeah I'm the shit
Up in this bitch
Up in this bitch
Yeah I'm the shit
Yeah I'm the shit
Up in this bitch
Up in this bitch
Yeah I'm the shit

(Jermaine)
See now I'd probably been in this shit the longest
I don't deal with the fake and the phoniest
Girls treat me like I'm one of the Jones's
Give her dick and all types of bonuses
I don't really even know who song this is
But I heard it and jumped right on this shit
If the shoe fit you better wear it
And I swear it you see me

She asked me what my name is
Told her I was famous
You don't know who Jermaine is
She must be brainless
Since the day I came in
Don't know where them lames went
But that ain't no issue
Baby get your boy some tissue

'Cause I'm the shit
Fish you as my whistle
Got your chick she doesn't miss you
She'll be with you when she kiss you
She'll be licking on my missile
No homo see my logo
And you'll hold shows like it's promo
It's tight I had to force it
Now they call me porcelain

'Cause I'm the shit
Yeah I'm the shit
Up in this bitch
Up in this bitch
Yeah I'm the shit
Yeah I'm the shit
Up in this bitch
Up in this bitch
Yeah I'm the shit
Yeah I'm the shit''''''''''''''''''''''''
