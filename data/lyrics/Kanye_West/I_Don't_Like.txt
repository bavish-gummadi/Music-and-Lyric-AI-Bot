(Intro - Pusha T)
Fraud niggas
Y'all niggas
That's that shit I don't like
Yo shit, make believe
Rappin' bout my own life
That's red, nigga
Red flag, nigga
The power's in my head, nigga
I get to beat the chair, nigga

(Pusha T)
SoHo, a TriBeCa
Three hoes, trifecta
Dope money, hope money
Hublot, my watch buddy
My pins better
You don't right
Trend setter, you clone light
Pay homage, you're K's vomit
I'm grateful, niggas I don't like

(Hook - Chief Keef)
I fought, nigga
That's that shit I don't like
I snitch, nigga
That's that shit I don't like
I bitch, nigga
That's that shit I don't like
Sneak ----
That's that shit I don't like

(Kanye West)
Smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal whole sound, that's a sound byte
The media crucify me like they dig Christ
They wanna find me not breathing like they found Mike
A girl who run her mouth only outta spite
But I'd never hit a woman, never in my life
I was in too deep like my car fife
In that pussy so deep, I could've drowned twice
Rolls-Ro, Jesus peace, with the brown ice
Eatin' good, vegitari with the brown rice
Girls kissin' girls, 'cause it's hot, right?
But unless they use the strap on, then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hangin' out the window, it's about to be a sug night
Free Bump Che, real nigga for life
Shout out to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice
Shout out to Ellie P, J Boogie, right?
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? Right?

(Hook - Chief Keef)
I fought, nigga
That's that shit I don't like
I snitch, nigga
That's that shit I don't like
I bitch, nigga
That's that shit I don't like
Sneak ----
That's that shit I don't like
Don't like, don't like
I snitch, nigga
That's that shit I don't like

(Chief Keef)
Fake Gucci, that's that shit I don't like
Smokin' on this dope, higher than the bright
This bitch gon' love there
She gon love me pipe
Sammy Sosa, that's that nigga that I like''''''''''''''''''''''''
