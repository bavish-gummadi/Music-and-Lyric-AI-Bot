I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless, oh
I need to know, if you about cutting
Or you about frontin, baby I need to know

I spent my last 8 checks's on a neck-e-lace
So I better get some sex for this, shiit
She wanna sip up on the cris-e-cris
Like it's Christ-e-mas and I'm St. Nicholas
I got her and her sister innn
That white benz, dyke twins
I ain't gon lie they only fives but together they ten's
And would I do 'em again? Hmmm, hmmm?
It's like old folks pissin 'cause it all depends
And it's no coke sniffin just juice and gin
Grey Goose to get you loose then hit the nigga producing
The track that got you movin, this track got you movin
So crazy you don't know what you doin'
You been telling them jokes, and it's not a rumor
I like a girl with a sense of humor
To give me head till it ache and it's not a tumor
So let me know what's goin' down 'fo I pay for this room 'cause

Now if you got it you got it
And if you don't then you prolly wont
Sissy niggaz call 'em maricon
I never hit a lady but my game might abuse em
By 'em boots just to tell them that I Jimmy Choose em
Take 'em back to confuse em
So she don't know if she coming or going
'Cause mami after I'm cumming I'm going
Back to show just frontin and flowin
Jewelry stuntin and glowin', this life is something I know it
And I been known to have a hoe or two
'Cause my diamonds yellow like a smoker tooth
I tell 'em step into the vocal booth
Roll a joint, smoke a few, after that I'm pokin you
After that it's over boo, baby grab your coat and VOOM

Now there's three different levels to relationships
Polly'n at the club wit em, talking getting affectionate
Leavin' and havin' sex with em, kickin them out
Trickin on models, dimes and rats, now I don't get into that
I kick that habit, I just, keep 'em impressed
Let 'em seat in the Lex, never, eat 'em unless
That fuckin' cat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin'
I got a nine in my pants and baby I'm just dyin' for a chance
Who ready to fuck? You ready to fuck? Off the sizzurp
Says she ready to cut, then she grabs my scissors
She prolly look good but what's scary to me
Henny make hoes look like Halle Berry to me''''''''''''''''
