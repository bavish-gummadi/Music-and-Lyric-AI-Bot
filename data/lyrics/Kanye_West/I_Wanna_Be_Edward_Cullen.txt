In Twilight, this guy I know
The palest skin you ever saw
All the girls still want him though
And now you know, I wanna be like Edward Cullen
I wanna be Edward Cullen
Wish I could be Edward Cullen

Wish I could be Cul-len
Wish that I could get all the girls, yo
Didn't have to breathe, didn't have to eat food
And of course I want to read everybodys thoughts
I wanna sparkle in the light, and drive a Volvo
And honestly I wanna play the Piano
Although it would suck to never turn 18
'Cause I know pedophiles will try to rape me
I wanna say that Dracula is my homie
Be a Vegetarian even though I eat meat
Wanna say that Carlisle is my daddy
That's such an awesome name, they'll all be jealous of me

Wish I could be in, Dr. Cullen's
Family and the Olympic Coven
Then Edward can, be my brethren
And he can tell me how to be more like him
Jasper and Emmett are so cool also
And Alice is like Katy Perry Hot N? Cold

Don't wanna be near Rosalie, though
'Cause I have a thing about being around a-holes
I'd run and tell Edward to leave Bella, please
It's obvious she would much rather be with me
And if he says no, then I'll have to agree
Cause honestly, he could beat the crap outta me

Walkin', walkin', walkins dumb
Wish I could do the Edward run
Then I would be real quick too
And I could get home in time for Scooby Doo
If I was Edward, I would be
1,000,000 times hotter then he could ever be
And James would be afraid of me
I would live happily
If I could read peoples thoughts
I wanna have Edwards life
I wanna graduate a thousand times

Cullen~''''''''''''''''
