1985 white Lamborghini countach, two of 'em
I need a slow motion video right now
'Cause I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shooting a nigga
Shooting a nigga, hey hey hey
I need a slow motion video right now ay ay

Damn baby pussy can't be your only hustle
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell
I mean a lot of niggas got money
So basically, Russell ain't the only Russell
Russell brand, Russell crow
Zero zero zero zero, a whole lot of 0's
What you after, actor money?
You in line behind currency, yeah you after money
Bullet proof condom when I'm in these hoes
Got staples on my dick (why) fuckin' centerfolds
And I swear to god they so cold
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes
I got my fur on feelin' like Jerome
She got her fur too, we get our his and her on
Don't look at the jewelry, or get your blur on
Too close, you comatose so dope you overdose
Get back, you over close
Oh no, the hood was strugglin'
But then I blessed them with that polo
Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo sponsored by Manolo
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos
Yeah and I'm cold bitch, please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed

Take it how you want till a nigga dead
(Till then I'm the illest motherfucer alive)
Whole world aiming at a nigga head
(Because I'm the illest motherfucker alive)

Yeah yeah uh huh hold up
King Hov, I'm exactly what the fuck you think
Eleven in a row, Bill Russell rings, Michael Jordan swag
Y'all think Michael Jordan bad
Nigga I got a 5 more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building now I'm on the Beatles ass
Niggas hear watch the throne,
Yeah it's like the Beatles back
Bey' Bey' my yoko ono,
Rih' Rih' complete the family
Imagine how that's gon' look front row at the Grammys
Fuck your awards like Eddie Morphy's couch
The Roc is in the building we should have stayed in the house
I don't even know what we doing here
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin' waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggas fashion is weak, they be wastin' all the models
Got the oversized Rolley let me show the how to do it
When I say it then you see, it ain't only in the music
Basquiats, Warhols serving as my muses
My house like a museum, so I see 'em when I'm peeing
Usually you have this much taste you European
That's the end of that way of thinking, nigga never again
Know when to leave when the heat is coming, I learned that
This is where De Niro would be if he ain't turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova this is real life
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like

I need a slow motion video right now
'Cause I'm moving in slow motion slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shooting a nigga
Shooting a nigga hey hey hey
I need a slow motion video right now ay ay''''''''''''''''
