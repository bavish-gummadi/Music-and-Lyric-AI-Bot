Ready!, Huh.(Background Sergeant giving orders)
Yeah! um
Jesus, Jesus talk to me
Jesus, Jesus talk with me
Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus, Jesus,
Come on!
(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way now the devil can't break me down
Jesus walk with me)


(Kanye)
Between the girls and the jewelry
The devil trying to lure me
And view of me
(Jesus walks with me)
My pastor shaking his head
He ain't sure of me
But surely
(Jesus walks with me)
Then he ask
Do you say your prayers at least 2 a week?
I ain't talking to God I know what I've been doing G.
Do you know how I be embarrassed? my prez sound
Like Ben Stiller on Meet the Parents

And I ain't good with that 'give us our day',
The slaves was trying to give us our free
I'm trying to give us, us pay,
Now you know how them strippers was,
We was all ghetto-fabulous all at the rooms at the
Cyberus, from this Jacuzzi wild can you cleanse us?
Can you please unfog my Cardierre lenses?
God sends signs sometimes only in glimpses
For me I almost died falling asleep in them Benzes
Theirs something about this beat that get me tranquilized
And when I play it at my shows I feel sanctified
And HE gives me direction when I can't decide
He is alive!, how can you tell me he ain't when I said

(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus Walks)
The only thing I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus Walks)
And Now I think there's something I can say now that will right my wrongs
(Jesus Walks)
I finally talked to God and I ain't afraid cause his love
Is so strong

(Ma$e)
Before you take me name, take my fame,
Why you had to take my shame, take my flaws, take my blame
Feel my dirt, conceal my hurt, See my bruise, and this you walk in my shoes
You weren't there when I was in deep thought.
When I had two choice, kill him or either leave New York
But I'm a truth tellea and that's why I say what I'm sayin'
And the only thing the radio playin' is cause you be payin'
It ain't about who really hot no more
Beats would knock no more
So who cares who flop no more
I realize that most labels pay you for lies
And all that blood do is gain disguise
That you're favorite artist shhhh
I know you hear that huh you wanna fear that what
Your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that
(Uh) Con the rap slash John the Baptist,
Prepare the way for what I came to say today
They deceived us, had us thinking Jesus really didn't need us
When he loved up all you
He loved them boys in hallway up in Broadway
Even those who meet him for dope every 4 days
To the strippers in broad day up in Norway
To the Detroit player Gators in Moreys
With me it's not just bars and music I walk with God
I have the scares to prove it, ugh

(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus Walks)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus Walks)
Everybody out there just lift your hands right now and say this with me:
'Father I thank you, for forgiving me, for everything I
Ever done, for Jesus walking with me, for dying for me,
Raising for me, and all my sins have been forgiven,
I'm a changed man, I'm healed I'm delivered,
I'm rich and It's all because of him' Now
Walk with me, Walk with me, Wha Wha Walk with
Me Walk with me''''''''''''''''
