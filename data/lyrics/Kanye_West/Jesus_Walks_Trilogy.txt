Order, Huh
Yo... We at war
We at war with terrorism... racism... but most of all we at war with ourselves

(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me, with me, with me)

You know what the Midwest is?
Young and Restless
Where restless n*ggas might snatch ya necklace
And next these n*ggas might jack ya Lexus

Somebody tell these n*ggas who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of Chi where death is
Top floor of the view alone will leave you breathless- Uh!
Try to catch it- Uh!- it's kinda hard

Getting choked by detectives- yeah, yeah- now check the method
They be asking us questions, hara**, and arrest us
Saying "We eat pieces of s*** like you for breakfast!"
Huh?! y'all eat pieces of s***? What's the basis?

We ain't goin' nowhere, but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke- rental car from Avis
My Mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well Mama, I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone till November, I got packs to move- I hope

(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now (I want Jesus)

(Jesus Walks)
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus Walks with me)
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)

God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long... so long

So long
(Jesus Walks with me... fades)

To the hustlas, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers
(Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of Welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)

Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models- we rap we don't think

I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus

So here go my single dawg radio needs this
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, video tape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played

Huh?
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins

And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out

(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me) fades)
The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now''''''''''''''''
