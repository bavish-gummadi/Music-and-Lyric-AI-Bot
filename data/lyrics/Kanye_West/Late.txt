The Whatnauts:
Little girl, please stop your crying
'Cause I'll be late for that

Kanye West:
I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

The Whatnauts:
Little girl, please stop your crying
'Cause I'll be late for that

Kanye West:
Stop all your blood clot cryin', I was flyin'
Made it to school with barely enough time to sign in
Yeah, I hear the alarm, yeah, I hear ya mom
Yeah yeah, I don't want be broke when I'm thirty-one
They said the best classes go to the fastest
Sorry Mr. West, there's no good classes and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even pre-requits?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin'
With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin'
Man, this is a insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benzo?
Like old folks pissin', I guess it all depends, oh, oh

The Whatnauts and Kanye West:
Little girl, please stop your crying (Stop your cryin' baby)
'Cause I'll be late for that

Kanye West and the Whatnauts:
I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right

The Whatnauts:
Little girl, please stop your crying
'Cause I'll be late for that

Kanye West:
You know when you be late, you miss all the lights
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight
That night, that night, that night
Baby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin' it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian-like
Hm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes
Five hours later, I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin' but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin' 'cause I'm finally here, yeah

The Whatnauts:
'Cause I'll be late for that
I'll be late for that
I'll be late for that
I'll be late for that''''''''''''''''
