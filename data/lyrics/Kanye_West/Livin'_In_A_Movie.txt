Yo, this sound like some movie shit right?
Get ya popcorn, get ya condiments, you don't wanna miss nothin', ok listen

They call me Edward Scissorhands 'cause I'm tryin' to cut
She claim she got cramps, I'm gone get you to suck
And you not gon use ya teeth ya hear?
You gon find out What Lies Beneath right here
The Preachers Wife don't give head? Get a divorce man
The kids been callin you the headless horseman
Like Sleepy Hollow see she swallow
Suck like ol girl got booed at Apollo
13 Ghost use my Hollow Man's for Friday 13th
You be Ghost, Backdraft from the toast
Niggaz who drop names is, oh so shameless
Get a chain that's stainless, they Almost Famous
My bling got 'em callin me, Lord Of The Rings
The Shining make it hard for her to Do The Right Thing
But I Don't Say Word, I'll never tell
Until you get a Kanye beat, you'll never sell

I'm livin' a movie, not livin' by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose ya cool
1,2 Ye comin' for you, 3,4 better lock your door
5,6, 7,8, 9,10 never sleep again

Shits deeper, than The Sleepers
Jeeper Creep-up on your block and cops Clock-us
Try to Baller Block-us, use Absolute Power
You gave him 9 1/2 Weeks, why you tryin' to Rush Hours huh?
And in The Cell don't drop soap in the showers huh
They try to give me Life, I'm out in a hour huh
Back on the block wit more Juice than Pac
Makin' Mo' Money 'cause of The, The, The, The Roc

I said some shit like, umm, you in my things like Suicide Kings
There's only Three Kings, Me, Myself and Irene, you know what I'm sayin'''''''''''''''''''''''''
