I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, till it's over, love
Till we lose control, system overload
Screamin' no, no, no, no, no

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got somethin' to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you fo' it finally got through?
You lose, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life
We're just racin' time, where's the finish line?

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
No, I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' gone
Keep it on a roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby, I'm confused
You choose, you choose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road, too many times before
I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose, you lose
You lose
You lose
You lose''''''''&''''''''''
