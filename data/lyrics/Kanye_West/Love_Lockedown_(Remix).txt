(Kanye West)
I'm not lovin' you
Way I wanted to
What I had to do
Had to run from you
I'm in love with you
But the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me
All the way home

So you never know
Never never know
Never know enough
Till it's over love
Till we lose control
System overload
Screamin no no no no no

I'm not lovin' you
Way I wanted to
See I wanna move
But can't escape from you
So I keep it low
Keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown

Keepin' your love lockdown
Your love lockdown

Now keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown

Now keep your love lockdown
You lose

I'm not lovin' you
Way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool
So I keep it true
I got something to lose
So I gotta move
I can't keep myself and still keep you too

So I keep in mind
When I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home
In the danger zone
How many times did I take for it finally got through
You lose, you lose

I'm not lovin' you
Way I wanted to
See I had to go
See I had to move
No more wastin time
You can't wait for life
We're just racin time
Where's the finish line

So keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown

Keepin' your love lockdown
Your love lockdown

Now keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown

Now keep your love lockdown
You lose

I'm not lovin' you
Way I wanted to
I bet no one knew
I got no one new
I know I said I'm through
But got love for you
But I'm not lovin' you
Way I wanted to

Gotta keep it goin'
Keep the lovin' goin'
Keep it on a road
Only God knows
If I'll be with you
Baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose

I'm not lovin' you
Way I wanted to
Where I want'a go
I don't need you
I've been down this road
Too many times before
I'm not lovin' you
Way I wanted to

So keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown

Keepin' your love lockdown
Your love lockdown

Now keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown

Now keep your love lockdown
You lose [x5]
