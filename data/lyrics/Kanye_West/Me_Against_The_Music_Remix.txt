All my people in the crowd
Grab a partner, take it down!

It's me against the music
It's just me
And me
Yeah
C'mon
Hoah
Hey Britney
Are you ready?
Uh huh
Are you?
Uh

And no one cares
It's whippin'my hair, it's pullin' my waist
To hell with stares
The sweat is drippin' all over my face
And no one's there
I'm the only one dancin' up in this place
Tonight I'm here
Feel the beat of the drum, gotta get with that bass

I'm up against the speaker, tryin' to take on the music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in a zone, I wanna get in a zone (I wanna get in a zone)
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
Tryin' to hit it, chic-a-taa
In a minute I'm a take a you on, I'm a take a you on (I'm a take a you on)
Hey, hey, hey

All my people on the floor
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people wantin' more
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya
All my people round and round
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people in the crowd
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya

So how would you like a friendly competition?
Let's take on the song (Let's take on the song, let's take on the song)
It's you and me baby, we're the music
Time to party all night long (All night long, all night long)

Hoah, huh, yeah, let's go!

We're almost there
I'm feelin' it bad and I can't explain
My soul is bare
My hips are movin' at a rapid pace
Baby feel it burn
From the tip of my toes, runnin' through my veins
And now's your turn
Let me see what you got, don't hesitate

I'm up against the speaker, tryin' to take on the music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in a zone, I wanna get in a zone (I wanna get in a zone)
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
Tryin' to hit it, chic-a-taa
In a minute I'm a take a you on, I'm a take a you on (I'm a take a you on)
Hey, hey, hey

Get on the floor, baby lose control
Just work your body and let it go (Let it go)
If you wanna party, just grab somebody
Hey Britney
We can dance all night long

Hey Britney, you say you wanna lose control
Come over here I got somethin' to show ya
Sexy lady, I'd rather see you bare your soul
If you think you're so hot, better show me what you got
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
(Grab a partner, take it down!)
C'mon Britney lose control, watch you take it, take it down
(Grab a partner, take it down!)

Get on the floor, baby lose control
Just work your body and let it go
If you wanna party, just grab somebody
Hey Britney
We can dance all night long

All my people in the crowd
Let me see you dance
(Grab a partner, take it down!)
C'mon Britney lose control
Watch you take it, take it down
(Grab a partner, take it down!)

Hmm...
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
