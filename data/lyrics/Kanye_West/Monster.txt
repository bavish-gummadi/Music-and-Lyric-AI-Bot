Bon Iver:
I shoot the lights out
Hide till it's bright out
Whoa, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

Rick Ross:
Bitch, I'm a monster, no good blood sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

Kanye West:
Gossip gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert

Profit profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hand

Oh, the best living or dead hands down, huh?
Less talk more head right now, huh?
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm bout to take it to another level bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double no assist
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now
This that goose and malibu, I call it Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with the new style
Throw that motherfucker, "Well, whatchu gon' do now?
Whatever ever I wanna do, gosh it's cool now"
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you will never get on top of this
So mommy best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
I put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruise her esophagus
Head of the class and she just want a swallowship
I'm living the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

Kanye West:
Gossip gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert

Profit profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hand

Jay-Z:
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Lochness
Goblin, Ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage a village, women and children
Everybody wanna know what my Achilles heel is?
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood suckers
All I see is these niggas I've made millionnaires
Milling about, spilling there feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

Kanye West:
Gossip gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert

Profit profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'mma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fucking hand

Nicki Minaj:
Pull up in a monster automobile, gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
First things first I'll eat your brains
Then I'mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a muthafucking monster do
Hairdresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50k for a verse, no album out
Yeah my money's so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it
Hotter than a middle eastern climate, find it
Tony Matterhorn dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties, when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, 'cause she's fake
She's on a diet but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Am should mnage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfucking monster

Bon Iver:
I, I crossed the line, line
And I'll, I'll let God decide, cide
I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

I, I crossed the line, line
And I'll, I'll let God decide, cide
I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

I, I crossed the line, line
And I'll, I'll let God decide, cide
I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home''''''''''''''''''
