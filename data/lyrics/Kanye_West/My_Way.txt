I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -

(Verse One)
It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday
The ROC got "-Ye" but they ain't snortin' it
They just got him up at Baseline recordin' shit
Yeah I've been broke
Now I'm good bitch
I ain't no Kennedy
But I'm hood rich
So I say my way to thank you to the ghetto
And everybody else, thank you very little
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path
I've been beatin', but now broken through the darkest past
It's sort of like when King spoke and said, "We free at last."
Ain't nothin' free from that point dawg
We needed cash
And we need it fast
We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last
Now all the blacks cookin' up, that almost white
'Cause gettin' green makes 'em treat us like we almost white
Almost

I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -

(Verse Two)
It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
Niggas wanna diss K
On they're local mix-tapes
There they go again, lyin' to consumers
Get their hair cut in the little shop of rumors
Your lil' sloppy with your cockiness ain't ya
A little arrogant with all your comparisons
'Cause as far as the Chi
I got the most plaques since the beginnin' to rap
But nah, y'all ain't mentionin' that
Y'all just talk about my dough
How I left Chicago
How I'm the only one eatin'
Shut your pie hole
And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' that high doe
Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say?
Only difference between you and me, you are gay
Ah, did he get his feelings hurt?
Nah, he's got titties under his shirt

I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -

(Verse Three)
It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
When you walk straight, niggas tend to look at you sideways
I say, "Fuck that dog, I get my own way"
Niggas ain't believe me till they see me on TV
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway
Then passin' up Freeway, just like it's a relay
We stay 4 stars, or better
'Cause the couches in the rooms got, more leather
And we gon' flick harder, when we could afford better
And back, before Benz's, when we could afford Jettas
You still dress Ardjo, but only pay partial
Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's
Polo and Carbesher'), we into them things dawg
Back in '96 we was livin' like kings dawg
40 cals or better, tottin' them things dawg
So up the Turkish link, and take them rings off

I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -
I did it my way''''''''''''''''
