My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism, that's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And this rich nigga racism, that's that "Come in, please buy more
What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas now everybody playing
Spending everything on Alexander Wang, new slaves

You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

I throw these Maybach keys, I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves, I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves, I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves, I see the blood on the leaves
They throwing hate at me, want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation, y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves, I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out, I'm going Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free, you niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwing contracts at me, you know that niggas can't read
Throw 'em some Maybach keys, fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves, y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye, y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country, so you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters, so I can smash their recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA, teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up, they tryna make new state
See that's that privately owned prison, get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons, bragging 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house, I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse and in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up, I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out, now what the fuck they gon' say now?

I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
'Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again

Frank Ocean:
Too high again, too high
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Too high, yeah

Kbor Jnos:
Egyszer a nap gy elfradt
Elaludt mly zld t ln
Az embereknek fjt a stt
 megsajnlt, eljtt kznk
Igen''''''''''''''''''''''''
