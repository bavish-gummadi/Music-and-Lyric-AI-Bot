(She really thought that)
Yeah
(Yeah, she's so paranoid)
Yeah, that's good, paranoid

Why are you so paranoid?
Don't be so paranoid
Don't be so

Baby, don't worry about it
Lady, don't even think about it
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things

Tell me right now, you really wanna spend your whole life alone?
A little time out might do you good, might do us good before we be done for good
'Cause I could make it good, I could make it hood
I can make you come, I can make you go
I can make you high, I can make you fly
Make you touch the sky, hey maybe so
All of the time, you be up in mine checking through my cell phone, baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night
Here's another fight, oh here we go

Kid Cudi, Mr. Hudson, and Kanye West:
(Baby, don't worry about it
Lady, we'll go out to the floor)
Anyway they don't know you like I do (They don't know)
They'll never know you (Never know)
Anyway they don't know you like I do (Never know)
They'll never know you

Kanye West:
All of the time you wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you're here with me, show some gratitude leave the attitude way back at home
Yeah, you see 'em look, baby let 'em look give us cold looks 'cause we look cold
Yea you heard about all the word of mouth, don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world lost in the world till you finally let that thing go
You wanna check in to the heartbreak hotel but sorry we're closed

Kid Cudi, Mr. Hudson, and Kanye West:
(Baby, don't worry about it
Lady, we'll go out to the floor)
Anyway they don't know you like I do (Hey, to the floor, hey)
They'll never know you (Never know)
Anyway, they don't know you like I do (They don't know)
They'll never know you

Kanye West:
Baby, don't worry about it
Lady, don't even think about it
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong thing
You worry 'bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing
You worry 'bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing
You worry 'bout the wrong thing

Kid Cudi and Mr. Hudson:
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you

Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you''''''''&''''&''&''''
