Wise man say, wise man say
Wise man say, "You'll never figure out real love"
Never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love

It's so crazy, crazy-crazy, I got everything figured out
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about
No doubt, everything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what real love was about
Do you think I sacrifice real life
For all the fame and flashing lights?
Do you think I sacrifice a real life
For all the fame and flashing lights
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no Y.S.L. that they could sell
To get my heart, out of this hell and my mind, out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn, back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like? I ask you tonight
To live a real life
I just wanna be a real boy
They always say "Kanye, he keeps it real boy"

Pinocchio's story is, I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes to be a real boy

It's funny, Pinocchio, lied, and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep running
It's like I'm lookin' for something out there, tryna find something
I turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing
What does it feel like to live real life, to be real?
Not some facade on TV that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say, "Where's my camera?"
For everybody that sees you, to say, "Sign a autograph"
For everybody that sees you cryin', say, "You oughta laugh"
You oughta laugh

I just wanna be a real boy, Pinocchio's story goes
I just wanna be a real boy, Pinocchio's story goes

And there is no Gepetto to guide me
No one right beside me, the only one was behind me
I can't find her no more, I can't follow no more, I can't
The only one that come out on the tour and stays
Back when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be get got
And the day I moved to LA, maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream
Chasin' everything we seen, up on the TV screen
And when uh, the Benz was left, and the clothes was left
And the hoes was left, you talk the hoes to death
Thinkin' the money that the, you spend the dough to death
And tell me what be left for a real boy?
They say, "Kanye, you keep it too real boy"

Perspective, and wise man say
"One day, you'll find your way"
The wise man say, "You'll find your way"
The wise man say, "You'll find your way"
