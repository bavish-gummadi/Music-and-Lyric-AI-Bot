We in the time of our lives baby
Turn the music up, Primetime

Yeah, Primetime, beat by Dion, our third eon
That's what the fuck we on
Mo' money, forty year old phenom
My fifteen minutes of fame has stretched beyond
At forty two be better than twenty fours,
I carried the four five, that's the forty eighth law
Still wearing my twenty three's they can't fuck with the boy
Far as them sixteen's, I'm twenty three of it all
Primetime, riding that six deuce
That nine eleven I only subtract the roof
Started in eighty eight,
Got warm in ninety two,
I landed in ninety six
That's the year I came through
I hit the club, ordered some gray Goose
Switched it for Ciroc to give Puff's stock a boost
New money, I found the fountain of youth
I'm headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontaine Bleu
A case of Ace, make it two, nigga we rolling, beat the deuce
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do (ooh)

The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do, huh
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh

Primetime, basking in the lime
Cassius in his prime, coloring out of the line
'Cause they don't want nobody that's colored out of the lines
So I'm late as a motherfucker, colored people time
Damn Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
Well, Adam gave up a rib so mine better be prime
Niggas gon' kill me, I swear they better be lying
I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind
Primetime, never hit these heights
I mean it's like, it's like our first 1st class flight
I'm trippin' on it, socks on marble floors
I'm slippin' on it, champagne, I'm sippin' on it
Shit taste different, don't it?
You know what, you right
It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life
"When you coming home" That's a text from my wife
I told her, run a bubble bath
And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherfucker till I call you back
I mean who says shit like that, and doesn't laugh (un-huh)

The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do, huh
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh''''''''''''''''
