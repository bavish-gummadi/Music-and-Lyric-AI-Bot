Hey baby

Or was you giving me the eye (the eye)
You said maybe (yeah)
Well you crazy
Because I know I'm too fly
I already know I'm too fly (too fly) [Repeat x3]
Yeah I know what you like.

Like now I'm off the wine (wine)
And we can take our time (time)
So much I want to I wants to fronts spilled the bump when we grind
My uh in is ya body
My uh is in ya mind
Check my dictionary
That ass is so divine
It slippery when its wet girl
I can read the signs
I knocked and I knocked (uh) can I come inside
I knocked and I knocked girl can I come inside
I feel like its home when I'm in between ya thighs
It's the joy, and the pain, and the bites and the brain
What make it feel so good
That type of stuff you can't explain
I do what I do to do to make it rain
You got the invite tonight
And I'm so glad ya came
Cause you the type that danger we gain in yo
Mic check like the way I begin my show
Girl I come from chi-ca-so N I go
Turn around its about to be a TKO

Some call me com (com)
Some call me the red (red)
You can call me daddy, I'ma put ya to bed
An appetite for seduction
And it gotta be fed
Her sexual eruption got ya hitting ya head
On the board
And knock and screaming, oh lord
We exchange like students 'cause I student abroad
And listen to ya body and low key parting
And I keep pushing and pushing
You bout to volley 'em up
We the type to make loving and we up
We take a ride down south cause you need to re-up
Girl you call me big bank like I was saving it up
I'm the doctor I can hold it till my patients is up

I know I know ya spot baby

When we do it like we don't want it to end
Its 3 PM we goin' do it again.

(Repeat x2)
Come on girl lets go
To distant lands unknown
We can fly on air
If love is everywhere,
For you and me''''''''''''''''
