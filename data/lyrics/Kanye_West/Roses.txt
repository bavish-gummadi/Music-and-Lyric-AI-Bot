I know it's past visiting hours but can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures, he claim her heart can't take the anaesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure, that little thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin'
Hey chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time, "Remember when I was nine?"
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin like, "What kind of doctor can we fly in?"
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS and all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA, right now she'd be okay?
But since she was just a secretary, worked for the church for thirty-five years
Things supposed to stop right here, my grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he's strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse, "Did you do the research?"
She asked me, "Can you sign some T-shirts?"
Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?
You don't see that we hurt? But still

Bill Withers:
I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

Kanye West:
They outside of the emergency room, room, you can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon but right now she asleep, sleep, sleep
My mama say they say she could pass away anyday
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay, and Aunt Jean
So many aunties we could have an auntie team
Feel like Amerie, it's just one thing when they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high to get there, we run, we fly, we drive
'Cause with my family we know where home is so instead of sending flowers, we're the roses

Bill Withers:
I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
Oh, Rosie brings the sunshine, oh

I smile when roses comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

Bill Withers and Patti LaBelle:
I smile when Rosie come to see me
And I'm sad, when Rosie goes away
Oh Rosie brings the sunshine (Say)

Patti LaBelle:
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day
Momma can't wait for the clouds to break
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no, say
Tellin' you the truth now
Said I can't wait, uh-uh
I won't wait, no''''''''''''''''''
