Why would she make calls out the blue?
Now I'm awake, sleepless in you

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will then play you will
I pray you will

Mrs. So Fly crash lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
One day you will, I pray you will

When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool, then lose control

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
You will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will if you will
I pray you will

I wish this song would really come true
I admit, I still fantasize about you, about you

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don' say you will
You will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Please say you will for real
I pray you will''''''''&''''&''&''''
