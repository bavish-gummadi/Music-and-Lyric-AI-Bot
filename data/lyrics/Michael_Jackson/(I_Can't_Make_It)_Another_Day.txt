My life has taken me beyond the planets
And the stars
And you're the only one
That could take me this far
I'll be forever searching for your love

I walked away but I was wrong
I can't make it another day
You're the one that makes me strong
I can't make it another day
You're the fire that keeps me warm
I can't make it another day
How did I get through this storm
I can't live another day without your love

At night I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you
I've opened up my heart I wan't you to come through
I've closed my eyes, I'm searching for your love

I walked away but I was wrong
I can't make it another day
You're the one that makes me strong
I can't make it another day
You're the fire that keeps me warm
I can't make it another day
How did I get through this storm
I can't live another day without your love''''''''''''''''''''''''
