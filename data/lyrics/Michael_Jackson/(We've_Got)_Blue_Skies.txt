We've got blue skies, we've got blue skies

It seems like only yesterday
You gave your love to me
And we made a vow that through the years
Our love would always be.
Whenever doubts would fill my mind
You'd brush my fears away
Look into my eyes and hold me close
And this is what you'd say

We've got blue skies, now can't you see?
There'll never ever be another love for me.

The pleasant dreams we shared
Made our love stronger with each day
And the fears that haunted me
Seemed like a million miles away.
When friends we knew would come to me
With lies about your love
I'd tell them happiness and sunny skies
Are all we're thinking of
We're so in love
We're thinking of.

Blue skies
Blue skies

I see you there, you're kissing him
How can this really be?
Well, I guess it's time to realize
My dreams are more to me
And as I walk off thinking
What a fool I must have been
Like an echo from my lips today
I hear you telling him

We've got blue skies, now can't you see?
There'll never ever be another love for me.
We've got blue skies, now can't you see?
There'll never ever be another love for me.
Blue skies, we've got blue skies
Blue skies, we've got blue skies
Blue skies, we've got blue skies, oh baby

We've got blue skies, now can't you see?
There'll never ever be another love for me.
We've got blue skies, now can't you see?
There'll never ever be another love for me.
Blue skies, we've got blue skies
Blue skies, we've got blue skies
Blue skies, we've got blue skies, oh baby''''''''''''''''''''''''
