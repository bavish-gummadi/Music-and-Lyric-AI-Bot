Too bad, forget it, cause there's Al Capone in it
So sad, you regret, cause the man is out tonight

Should have told, nobody ever should talk about this
And now I scream, nobody should be treated this way
Should have told, nobody ever should talk about this
And now I scream, nobody should be treated this way
Should have told, nobody ever should talk about this
And now I scream, nobody should be treated this way
Should have told, nobody ever should talk about this
And now I scream, nobody should be treated this way

I get in my getaway, after the scary might just say
Just done it on that cold as ice, screaming my
Now it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him a getaway?
Why did you let him a getaway?
Why did you let him a getaway?''''''''''''''''
