All along, had to talk about it
Like a two-edged sword, he touched you and it stabs me
All along, I knew you were a phony girl
Sit behind the mask, and you control your world

I sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth, but that's your hiding place
You say you love me, that it's hard to see
'Cause when he's in your arms,
You're throwing rocks at me

Who do you love?
Is it me? Well?
I don't know
Who do you love?
You know me

There is nothing in your eyes
That's the way you cry, girl
All is grand, all is bright
You're just studying my mind

I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
When I come to you, you're sitting in your room
You sit around the strangest place
So take off the mask, so I can see your face

Who do love?
Is it me, is it him? Well?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I know you

Heaven must be wearing
Your smile is scary (you got me scared, girl)
Insincere, empty tears
Where's your soul?
Where did it go?

Heaven must be wearing
Your smile is scary
Insincere, empty tears
Where's your soul?
Where did it go?

I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
When I come to you, you're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask, so I can see your face

Who do you love?
Is it me? Well?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I know you

Who do you love?
Is it me? Well?
I don't know
Who do you love?

I don't know
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it)''''''''''''''''
