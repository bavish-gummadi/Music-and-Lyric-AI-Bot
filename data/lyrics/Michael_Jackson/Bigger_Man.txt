See you out on the block
With your man,
Got me on the stand
Girl why you hanging around
When he put you down
So I gotta put you up on me
'Cause it's a shame
That girl you settle for less
When you know that I'm blessed

You need to open up you're mind (you're mind)
Give me the chance to get inside
(To get inside)

I can I can
Do it better than he can
I will I will
Be a bigger man
I am I am
Everthing you need and more
Can I can i
Show you I'm a bigger man

Let me know
When he can't please you
I'll come right through
He'll give inches or for miles
I can make you smile
'Cause I no that you
Might be afraid to
Walk away
But I'll protect you
From him
So let the games began

You need to open up your mind
(Open up your mind)
Give me the chance to get inside
(To get inside)

I can I can
Do it better than he can
I will I will
Be a bigger man
I am I am
Everything you need and more
Can I can i
Show you I'm a bigger man

Break down:
I know
(I know)
For sure
That he can never measure up
'Cause I got so much more
To give you
More

I can I can
Do it better
I will I will
Be a bigger man
I am I am
Everything you need and more
Can I can i
Show you I'm a bigger man

Show you I'm a bigger man
Oh ay oh''''''''''''''''
