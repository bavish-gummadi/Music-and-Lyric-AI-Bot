Hold my hand, feel the touch of your body cling to mine
You and me, makin' love, all the way through another night
I remember you and I, walking through the park at night
Kiss and touch, nothing much, let it blow just touch and go

Love me more, never leave me alone by house of love
People talk, people say what we have is just a game
Oh, I'll never let you go, come here girl
Just got to make sweet love till the break of dawn

I don't want the sun to shine, I wanna make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't stop lovin' you
I won't stop till break of dawn makin' love

Hold my hand, feel the sweat, yes you've got me nervous yet
Let me groove, let me soothe, let me take you on a cruise
There's imagination, I bet you've never been there before
Have you ever wanted to dream about those places you've never known?

Break of dawn, break of dawn
There's no sun up in the sky
Break of dawn, break of dawn
I can see it in your eyes
Break of dawn, break of dawn
Girl, you got to understand it's the way that I love you
Let me show you I'm your man, break of dawn

I don't want the sun to shine I wanna make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't stop lovin' you
I won't stop till break of dawn makin' love

I don't want the sun to shine I wanna make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't stop lovin' you
I won't stop till break of dawn makin' love

Let's not wait, the sun is out and let's get up and let's get out
It's the day, a brand new day, let's both go outside and play
Let us walk down the park, makin' love till it's dark
Let me move, let me soothe
Till the break of dawn and you know it's true, oh

I don't want the sun to shine I wanna make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't stop lovin' you
I won't stop till break of dawn makin' love

I don't want the sun to shine I wanna make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't stop lovin' you
I won't stop till break of dawn makin' love

I don't want the sun to shine I wanna make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't stop lovin' you
I won't stop till break of dawn makin' love

Break of dawn''''''''''''''''''
