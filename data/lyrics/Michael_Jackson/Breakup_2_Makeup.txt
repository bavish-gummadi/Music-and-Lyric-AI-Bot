Make it up girl, come on yeah. oh girl
Keep on the hook

I remember when you told me you had this crazy feelin'.
You said you lelt somethin' different.
What could you do to me now. Look what you done to me. You left the room and left me alone (why). I can't see why you did this to me, look at me right now (hee hee hee). Help me or leave me. I can not explain.

Be my lover, I wanna love you. Come for me baby, I love you baby, you don't no why baby. Break up 2 baby. Make up to me lady.

You say you don't love me, but you really do.

Be my love, I wanna love you girl. Come for me baby, I love you baby, you don't no why baby. Break up 2 baby. Make up to me lady.
