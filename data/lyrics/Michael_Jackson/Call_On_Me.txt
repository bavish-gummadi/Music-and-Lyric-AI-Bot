There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache pain
What can I do but wait for you?
Darling the days
I had were cold

Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live

But if it gets too rough
Call on me

Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need

If you can't get enough
Call on me

I'm so sad you're leaving
It's gonna to kill me
Not to be with you
But I want you to be happy
If heartache's what you want
Then I want it too

So goodbye with all my prayers
For your happiness in a world elsewheree
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me

Yes, happiness
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me... call on me

Yes, happiness
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me... call on me
