Oh, girl
I can't get ready
Oh, girl
I can't get ready

No, no, no
I can't get ready
For losing you

Girl, I can't get ready
No, no, no
For losing you
Oh, can't get ready
No, girl for losing you
Losing you

Thought I had your love
In the palm of my hands
But I let it slip away from me, girl

And now you're happy with another guy
Someone who doesn't make you cry
(He doesn't make you cry)
And now it's got me shedding tears
Oh, girl, how I wish you were here

'Cause I can't get ready
No, for losing you
No, no, no
I can't get ready
Oh, girl, for losing you
No, no, no
Can't get ready
Oh, girl, for losing you
Losing you

Girl, I took your love for granted
I know, I know, I treated you so unkind
And now the shoe is on the other foot
And you don't even took a second look
You told me there would come a time

Oh, girl
It's really blowing my mind
'Cause I can't get ready
No, no, no, no, no, for losing you
Oh, can't get ready
For losing you
No, no, no
Can't get ready
For losing you
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no little girl

Girl, I can't get ready
No, no, no for losing you
I can't get ready
No, no, no, no for losing you
Can't get ready
No, girl
For losing you
Losing you

Oh, I can't get ready
Oh, no, yeah
For losing you
I can't get ready
No, no, no for losing you''''''''''''''''''''''''
