Baby, baby

You put my heart in your face
And then you claim its some game
And then you tell all these lies
Cause you don't have alibi

(I'm gettin' a little sick of it baby)
(I'm getting frustrated)

'Cause I Can't Get Your Weight Off Of Me
(Uh-Oh)
'Cause I Can't Push You Away From Me
Even Though Your Skinny And Small
It's Your Love That's Too Tall
And Now It's Too Much, Baby!

You wave my love in my face
Even though it's too great
The power in you cannot hold it all

(And know she thinks I'm cheatin')
(And now I'm hardly breathin')

'Cause I Can't Get Your Weight Off Of Me
(Uh-Oh)
'Cause I Can't Push You Away From Me
Even Though Your Skinny And Small
It's Your Love That's Too Tall
And Now It's Too Much, Baby!

'Cause I Can't Get Your Weight Off Of Me
(Uh-Oh)
'Cause I Can't Push You Away From Me

Even Though Your Skinny And Small
It's Your Love That's Too Tall
And Now It's Too Much, Baby!

Too Much baby
Too Much Kissing
Too Much Love For Me

'Cause I'm Drowning In Sorrow Now
I said I had enough of your love
I want to take back
'Cause I miss you baby!
(Miss You)
(Baby!)

'Cause I Can't Get Your Weight Off Of Me
(Uh-Oh)
'Cause I Can't Push You Away From Me
Even Though Your Skinny And Small
It's Your Love That's Too Tall
And Now It's Too Much, Baby!

'Cause I Can't Get Your Weight Off Of Me
(Uh-Oh)
'Cause I Can't Push You Away From Me
Even Though Your Skinny And Small
It's Your Love That's Too Tall
And Now It's Too Much, Baby!''''''''''''''''''''''''
