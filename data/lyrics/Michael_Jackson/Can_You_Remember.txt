Can you remember
When we were babies?
We were always together
When we were kindergartners.

Now that you're grown, girl,
You left me all alone.
And you know I'll never find
No one to call my own.

So, girl, I love you, I love you
Don't you know I love you?

My Cherie, like for you
To remember if you can
Times we had and the time we shared
Sitting there in the grass.

Can you remember
When we were babies?
We were always together
And I never had no one but you.

When sunny skies are blue, girl,
You'll know that I love you.
And I'll always promise you
That this is what I'll do.

So, girl, I love you, I love you
Don't you know I love you?

My Cherie, like for you
To remember if you can
Times we had and the time we shared
Sitting there in the grass.''''''''''''''''
