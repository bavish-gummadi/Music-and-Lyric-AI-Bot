Whoa, whoa...
I'm reaching for you, and you're not even near
Still feeling your touch in the air
The thought of your kiss still lingers in my mind
Can't forget about the days when you were mine

Now I'm lying in the dark [lying in the dark]
Slowly dying from my broken heart

(My condition's getting worse)
[I see you and] man it hurts
(I need you here back in my life)
(It's critical, critical)
[Got me sick without your touch] without your touch
[I never thought it hurt this] much
(I need you here right by my side)
(It's critical, critical)

Been a week since you left, but time is standing still
I'm so weak from the fall, I lost the will
Put my pride on the shell, and beg for one more chance
Please tell me you'll try to understand

Now I'm lying in the dark [lying in the dark]
Slowly dying from my broken heart

(My condition's getting worse)
[I see you and] man it hurts
[I need you here back in] my life
[It's critical, critical] whoa

(Got me sick without your touch)
I never thought it hurt this much
[I need you here right] by my side
(It's critical, critical)

It's critical, I need your touch [put your hand upon my heart and I will heal it up]
Come and bring me back to life [back to life]
Get me back on my feet, and help me learn how to breathe again
With you I know I can, I know I can

[My condition's getting worse] my condition
[I see you and] I see you and man it hurts
[I need you here back in my life] my life
(It's critical, critical)
Got me sick without [your touch] without it
[I never thought it hurt this] I never thought it would
[I need you here] right by my side
[It's critical] critical

[My condition's getting worse] critical
[I see you and] man it hurts
[I need you here back] in my life
(It's critical, critical)
You got me sick without your touch
[I never thought it] hurt this much, no
[I need you here right by my side] side
[It's critical] critical

No-whoa... yeah... *sigh*''''''''''''''''
