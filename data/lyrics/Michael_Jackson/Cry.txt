Somebody shakes when the wind blows
Somebody's missing a friend (Hold on)
Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue when it's all gonna end again

Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth (Hold on)
When will this mystery unfold
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

If people laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is taking a life (Hold on)
Respect to believe in your dreams
So tell me where were you
When your children cried last night

Faces filled with madness
Miracles unheard of (Hold on)
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do is to reach for the truth, the truth

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

And when that flag glows there'll be no more wars
And when all 'cause I will answer all your prayers (Prayers)
Show the world...

You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight''''''''''''''''
