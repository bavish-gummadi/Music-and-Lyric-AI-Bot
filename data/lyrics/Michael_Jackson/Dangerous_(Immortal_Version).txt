The way she came into the place
 I knew right then and there
 There was something different about this girl
 The way she moved
 Her hair, her face, her lines
 Divinity in motion

 As she stalked the room
 I could feel the aura of her presence
 Every head turned feeling passion and lust
 The girl was persuasive
 The girl I could not trust
 The girl was bad
 The girl was dangerous

 One thing in life you must understand
 The truth of lust woman to man
 So open the door, and you will see
 There are no secrets
 Make your move, set me free

 I never knew but I was walking the line
 Come go with me
 I said I have no time
 And don't you pretend
 We didn't talk on the phone
 My baby cried she left me standing alone

 She's so dangerous
 The girl's so dangerous
 Take away my money
 Throw away my time
 You can call me honey
 But you're no damn good for me

 Dangerous
 The girl's so dangerous
 I have to pray to God
 'Cause I know how lust can blind
 It's a passion in my soul
 But you're no damn lover friend of mine

 Just open the door, and you will see
 This passion burns inside of me
 Don't say to me, you'll never tell
 Touch me there, make the move
 Cast the spell

 Keep it in the closet

 My time
 My Baby
