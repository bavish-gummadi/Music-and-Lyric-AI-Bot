The way she came into the place I knew right then and there,
There was something different about this girl.
The way she moved,
Her hair, her face, her lines,
Divinity in motion.
As she stalked the room I could feel the aura of her presence.
Every head turned feeling passion and lust.
The girl was persuasive,
The girl I could not trust.
The girl was bad.
The girl was dangerous.

She came at me in sections,
With the eyes of desire.
I fell trapped into her web of sin.
A touch, a kiss, a whisper of love,
I was at the point of no return.
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity,
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity.
This girl was persuasive,
This girl I could not trust.
The girl was bad.
The girl was dangerous.

You've been hit by,
You've been struck by,
A Smooth Criminal.

(Spoken): You know you want me.

Dangerous.
The girl is so dangerous.
Take away my money,
Throw away my time.
You can call me honey,
But you're no d*** good for me.
Dangerous.
The girl is so dangerous.
I have to pray to God,
'Cause I know that lust can blind. It's a passion in my soul,
But you're no d*** lover friend of mine.

My baby!
You been,
You take,
Uh,
You don't,
You don't,
Don't.
You turn,
My baby!

Dangerous! (echo)
Dangerous! (echo)
Dangerous! (echo)
You don't.
You don't.
Don't.
Dangerous! (echo)
Dangerous! (echo)
Dangerous! (echo)
