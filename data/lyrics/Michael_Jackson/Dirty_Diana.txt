Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

You'll never make me stay 
So take your weight off of me 
I know your every move 
So won't you just let me be 
I've been here times before 
But I was too blind to see 
That you seduce every man 
This time you won't seduce me 

She's saying that's ok 
Hey baby do what you please 
I have the stuff that you want 
I am the thing that you need 
She looked me deep in the eyes 
She's touching me so to start 
She says there's no turning back 
She trapped me in her heart 

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be!

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

She likes the boys in the band 
She knows when they come to town 
Every musician's fan 
After the curtain comes down 
She waits at backstage doors 
For those who have prestige 
Who promise fortune and fame 
A life that's so carefree 

She's saying that's ok 
Hey baby do what you want 
I'll be your night loving thing 
I'll be the freak you can taunt 
And I don't care what you say 
I want to go too far 
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana . . .
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana . . .
Diana!
Diana!
Dirty Diana!
It's Dia . . .aa . . .aa . . .come on!

She said I have to go home 
'Cause I'm real tired, you see 
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me
I said my baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight 
I didn't call on the phone 
To say that I'm alright 

Diana walked up to me
She said I'm all yours tonight
At that I ran to the phone
Saying "baby, I'm alright"
I said but unlock the door
Because I forgot the key
She said he's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me 

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on''''''''''''''''''
