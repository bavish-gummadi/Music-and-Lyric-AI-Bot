Father comes home from work, and he's scared today
Mother cries out the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he says "What's going on?"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone!"

She wrote that she is tired of stepdaddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her

Save me (from this living hell)
Save me ('cause I don't wanna know)
Save me (I'm tired and unfed)
Save me (cause this because of you) (Hoo)
Save me ('cause I'm on the bed)
Save me ('cause I don't want no more)
Save me (cause terror arrived)
Save me!

Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waiting there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair"
He's taking her on the streets, of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hard, girl that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there they told
He's arresting this little girl, she's only twelve years old, yeah!
