Ooh, ooh
Walk away
Walk away

Don't walk away
See I just can't find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you'll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray

And how can I stop losing you
How can I begin to say
When there's nothing left to do but walk away
Yeah

I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it's been so long now all I do is cry
Can't we find some love to take this away
'Cause the pain gets stronger every day

How can I begin again
How am I to understand
When there's nothing left to do but walk away
Yeah

See, now why
All my dreams been broken
I don't know where we're going
When everything we said and all we done now
Don't let go, I don't wanna walk away

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Hey
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Now why
All my dreams been broken
I don't know where we're going
And everything begins to set us free
Can't you see, I don't wanna walk away

If you go, I won't forget you girl
Can't you see that you will always be
Even though I had to let you go
There's nothing left to do
Don't walk away

If you go, I won't forget you girl
Can't you see that you will always be
Even though I had to let you go
There's nothing left to do
Don't walk away

If you go, I won't forget you girl
Can't you see that you will always be
Even though I had to let you go
There's nothing left to do
Don't walk away'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
