What about sunrise? What about rain?
What about all the things that you said we were to gain?
What about killing fields? Is there a time?
What about all the things that you said was yours and mine?

Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying earth, these weeping shores?

What have we done to the world? Look what we've done
What about all the peace, that you pledged your only son?
What about flowering fields? Is there a time?
What about all the dreams that you said was yours and mine?

Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying earth, these weeping shores?

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know, we've drifted far

What about forest trails? (Ooo, ooo)
Burnt despite our pleas (What about us?)

What about the holy land? (What about it?)
Torn apart by creed (What about us?)
What about the common man? (What about us?)
Can't we set him free? (What about us?)

What about children dying? (What about us?)
Can't you hear them cry? (What about us?)
Where did we go wrong? (Ooo, ooo)
Someone tell me why (What about us?)

What about baby boy? (What about it?)
What about the days? (What about us?)
What about all their joy? (What about us?)
What about the men? (What about us?)

What about the crying man? (What about us?)

Do we give a damn?''''''''''''''''''''''''
