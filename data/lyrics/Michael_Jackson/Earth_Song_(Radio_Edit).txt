What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores

Ah (Ah Ah) Ooh (Ooh...)

What have we've done to the world
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son
What about flowering fields
Is there a time
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, theses weeping shores

Ah (Ah Ah) Ooh (Ooh Ooh)
Ah (Ah Ah) Ooh (Ooh...)

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

Ah (Ah Ah) Ooh (Ooh Ooh)
Ah (Ah Ah) Ooh (Ooh...)
Ah (Ah Ah) Ooh (Ooh Ooh)
Ah (Ah Ah) Ooh (Ooh...)

Hey, what about yesterday (What about us)
What about the seas (What about us)
The heavens are falling down (What about us)
I can't even breathe (What about us)
What about everything (What about us)
We're ravaging the seas (What about us)
What about forest trails (ooh, ooh)
Burnt despite our pleas (What about us)
What about the holy land (What about it)
Torn apart by creed (What about us)
Where did we go wrong (ooh, ooh)
Someone tell me why (What about us)
What about babies (What about it)
What about the days (What about us)
What about all their joy (ooh, ooh)
Do we give a damn

Ah (Ah Ah) (Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!) Ooh (Ooh Ooh) (Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!)
Ah (Ah Ah) (Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!) Ooh (Ooh...)''''''''''''''''
