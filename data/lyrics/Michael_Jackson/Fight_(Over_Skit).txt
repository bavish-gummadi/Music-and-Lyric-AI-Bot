Why -would you take him away from this beautiful world it hurts 2 say good bye to some one you really cared about but I just can't say good bye to Micheal Jackson I can't am 2 little and to small 2 be hurt at my age well in all in loving memorizes that I have seen I has been a good time and bad times but that's just how life is you never know what's gunna happen or when were gunna die no does so hear are my good byes oh dear lord you took him away from us but I know you had ur reasons and I have my reasons in y he had 2 stay with us 'cause he makes lots of people happy in our world that you have created for us but now that you have taken him away you took others with him people died for him when they had heard that he had died so these is my good byes 2 the ones you took 2 but most just for Micheal Jackson may u R.I.P hears 2 u''''''''''''''''
