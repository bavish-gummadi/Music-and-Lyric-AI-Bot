Think about the generations and say we wanna make it a better place
For our children and our children's children
So that they know what's a better world for them
And think they can make it a better place

There's a place in your heart and I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try, you'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there if you care enough for the living
Make a little space, make a better place

Heal the world, make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

If you want to know why, there's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see, in this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living
Then it feels that always love's enough for us growing
Make a better world, make a better world

Heal the world, make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life, wound this Earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see, this world is heavenly, be God's glow

We could fly so high, let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear, together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
We could really get there if you cared enough for the living
Make a little space to make a better place

Heal the world, make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world, make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world, make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

You and for me
Make it a better place
You and for me
Make it a better place
You and for me
Make it a better place
You and for me
Heal the world we live in
You and for me
Save it for our children
You and for me
Heal the world we live in
You and for me
Save it for our children
You and for me
Heal the world we live in
You and for me
Save it for our children
You and for me
Heal the world we live in
You and for me
Save it for our children''''''''''''''''''
