Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take,
Maybe I'll stay, Heaven can wait

You're beautiful...
You're wonderful...
Incredible...
I love you so...
You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do,
If I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go
If I can't see your face, can't hold you close,
What good would Heaven be,
If the angels came for me I'd tell them no,

I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take,
Maybe I'll stay, Heaven can wait

Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on (Moving on)
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl (Oh-)
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her (-oh-oh-oh-)
Ain't nobody loving you the way we were (-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
What good would Heaven be,
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no,

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone (Yeah, my baby!)
I don't want nobody else to hold you (Don't you give it to me)
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
(You're my baby!) No, if the angels took me from this earth (Don't you give it to me)
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Oh no, can't be without my baby (I can't be without my baby)
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh
(You're my baby!) Oh no, can't be without my baby (Yeah, Don't you give it to me)
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy (I can't be without my baby)
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting (Yeah,)
Ooh (I love you girl, I need you baby, I want you baby)

(No!) No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take,
Maybe I'll stay, Heaven can wait

(Yeah,)
Oh, Just leave us alone,
(You're beautiful...
You're wonderful...
Incredible...
I love you so...)
Leave us alone
Please leave us alone
(You're beautiful...)
Please leave us alone
Oh, leave me alone
Please, leave me alone
I said, "Leave me alone"''''''''''''''''
