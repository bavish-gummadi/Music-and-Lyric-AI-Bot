If everyday was Christmas
If we could make believe
If everyone would care a little more
There'd be harmoney

The city is covered in snow tonight
The children fast asleep
I'm waiting for him, but he's nowhere in sight
And I wonder if he can hear me

Hey Santa
Hey Santa... Santa
I wish with all my might
Hey Santa
Hey Santa... Santa
Bring my baby home tonight

Why does it feel like it's colder than winter
Even by the fireside
My baby said he'd be home for Christmas
And now it's almost midnight
The Christmas lights up and down the street
Are such a sight to see
But all the presents by the tree
They don't mean a thing till he's with me

Hey Santa
Hey Santa... Santa
I wish with all my might
Hey Santa
Hey Santa... Santa
If you hear me won't you hurry
Bring my baby tonight

I know your sleigh is full inside
But won't you stop and give my baby a ride
I'll be waiting by candle light this Christmas
The Christmas lights up and down the street
Are such a sight to see
But all the presents by the tree
They don't mean a thing
Santa please hear me

Hey Santa
Hey Santa... Santa
I wish with all my might
Hey Santa
Hey Santa... Santa
If you hear me won't you hurry

Bring my baby tonight

The Christmas lights up and down the street
The presents by the tree
I hear a knock, oh can it be?
My wish is staring back at me

Hey Santa
Hey Santa... Santa
I guess you heard me tonight
Hey Santa
Hey Santa... Santa
I'm underneath the mistletoe
With my baby tonight

Sleigh ride...
It's Christmas time...

Hey Santa, can you bring me something good
(Something good, something good)?
Hey Santa, can you bring me something sweet
(Something sweet, something, something sweet)?
Like chocolate kisses or candy canes.
Gumdrops or butterscotch, fruity flavor, chewy rings.

Hey Santa, can you bring me something nice
(Something nice, something nice)?
Hey Santa, can you bring me something new
(Something new, something, something new)?
Like a diamond bracelet or a diamond ring.
How about a shiny new, baby blue, convertible?
Hey Santa, can you bring me everything?

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh?

Hey Santa, can I sing this song to you
(Sing to you, sing to you)?
Hey Santa, can you make my wish come true
(Make it true, make it, make it true)?
Can you fill my stocking with lots of treats?
Boxes with red and green, underneath the Christmas tree?
Hey Santa, can you bring me everything?''''''''''''''''
