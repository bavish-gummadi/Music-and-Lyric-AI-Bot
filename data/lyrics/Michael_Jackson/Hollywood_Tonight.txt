Lipstick in hand
Tahitian tanned
In her painted on jeans

She dreams of fame
She changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time, that means

She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
It's true, that you, may never ever have that chance again

West bound Greyhound
To tinsel town
Just to pursue her movie star dreams
She's giving hot tricks to men
Just to get in
When she was taught that that's not clean
Because she's only fifteen

She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
It's true, that you, may never ever have that chance again
(That chance again)
