Ain't no words to this song
You just dance and hum along
Said, ain't no words to this song, no
You just dance and hum along

Now, dance
Now, come on, hum with me
Just a little bit loud

Ain't no words to this song
You just dance and hum along
Ain't no words, ain't no words to this song
You see, we didn't have time to write none

Lemme see you dance
Hey, come on, now, hum with me

Ain't no words to this song, no
You just dance and hum along
Said, there ain't no words, no words to this song
You just dance and hum along

Soul sister, get it
Come on, y'all, let's hum some

Just a little bit louder
I said louder
I said louder''&''&''&''&''&''&''&''&
