Looking out across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
"Why, why, does he do me that way?"
If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
"Why, why, does he do me that way?"

Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
"Why, why, does he do me that way?"
If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature 
"Why, why, does he do me that way?"
I like living this way 
I like loving this way 

How why why
How why why

Looking out across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature 
"Why, why, does he do me that way?"
If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature 
"Why, why, does he do me that way?"
I like living this way, yeah 

How why why
