My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars
And you're the only one that could take me this far
I'll be forever searching for your love

Oh, I walked away but I was wrong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the one that makes me strong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the fire that keeps me warm
(I can't make it another day)
How will I get through this storm?
(I can't live another day without your love)

At night, I pray before I sleep in hopes of finding you
I've opened up my heart I want you to come through
I close my eyes I'm searching for your love

Oh, I walked away but I was wrong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the one that makes me strong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the fire that keeps me warm
(I can't make it another day)
How will I get through this storm?
(I can't live another day without your love)

I walked away but I was wrong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the one that makes me strong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the fire that keeps me warm
(I can't make it another day)
How will I get through this storm?
(I can't live another day without your love)

Hoo hoo! Go on now, baby, Hoo hoo!

I walked away but I was wrong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the one that makes me strong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the fire that keeps me warm
(I can't make it another day)
How will I get through this storm?
(I can't live another day without your love)

It's just too much for me
It's just too much for me
It's just too much for me''''''''''''''''''''''''
