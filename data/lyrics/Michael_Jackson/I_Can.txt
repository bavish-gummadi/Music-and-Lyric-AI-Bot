"I can touch the stars
I can touch the sun
Feel the wind in my face
Feel the power of the Great.
I can do everything
As true as I exist
I can, I can 
Because you're here with me."

Refrain: That's what I thought
When I was a child
Because You were there by my side
That's what I thought 
When I was a child
I didn't know the evil
Likes to drink even your blood

"I can fly as angels
I am one of them
Give me one white arch
And I'll show to them
And we'll show to them"

Refrain: That's what I thought
When I was a child

Because You were there by my side
That's what I thought 
When I was a child
I didn't know the evil
Likes to drink even your blood

Can I touch the stars
Can He lift me up
Will you hold my hand 
Than you can go back
That's all I'm asking now
Just some minutes to say
Just some minutes to say
Just some minutes to say:
That's what I thought 
When I was a child
I didn't know the evil
Likes to drink even your blood
And the never have enough
And they never have enough
God will they ever have enough?''''''''''''''''
