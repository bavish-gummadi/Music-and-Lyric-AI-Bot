I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't
Know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you
God I need you
I love you so much

Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name

Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you

Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer

I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring

Heaven's in my heart
At your call I hear harps
And angels sing

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you

I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you

At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true

When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you

You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do"
"I do"

This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you (woah)
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, hey, farewell to sorrow
This is my life and I want to see you for always

I just can't stop loving you (no, baby)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop, (no, what will I do? uh, ooh)
Then tell me just what will I do

I just can't stop loving you (hee, hee, heee, know I do girl)
I just can't stop loving you (you know I do)
And if I stop, then tell me, just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
