Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?

All the colors of the world should be
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother
And tell him twice
Spread the word and try to teach the man
Who's hating his brother,
When hate won't do, ooh
'Cause we're all the same, yes
The blood inside of me is inside of you
Now, tell me
Can you feel it,
Tell me Can you feel it,
Can you feel it, oh
When you see it's going down
Can you see it in your bones?
Can't you feel it, yeah.

You know I always, always wanted
You should keep on, because the force is got a lot of power in
It make me feel like, it make me feel like woo

Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough

Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough.

People always told me
Be careful of what you do
Don't go around
Breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me,
Be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth Hey hey hey

And a miracle
Has happened tonight!
