Just preaching the Bible and they still speakin' you're a lier
And you still deal with the fires
That they made...

Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah, you
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah

Why you wanna get me?
Dreams don't last forever
Why you wanna fix me?
See, if the police don't take it
God forsake it
I can't take it

Why you stab me in the back?

We're so gonna loose
And she, knows they got this to be
She... I dah dah dah dah dah

Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah people
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah

Why you wanna get me?
This dude won't last forever
Why you wanna hit me?
See, if the police don't take it
God forsake it
I'll fell breaking

Why you stab me in the back?''''''''''''''''''
