[Princess Stphanie of Monaco]
There's something I have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble, touch me
Don't hide our love, woman to man

[Michael]
She's just a lover
Who's doing me by
It's worth the giving
It's worth the try
You cannot cleave it
Or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it
You cannot burn it

She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)
Dare me
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)

It's just a feeling
You have to soothe it
You can't neglect it
You can't abuse it 
It's just desire 
You cannot waste it 
Then, if you like it 
Then, won't you taste it

She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)
Dare me
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)

[Princess Stphanie of Monaco]
One thing in life
You must understand
The truth of lust
Woman to man
So open the door
And you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move
Set me free

[Michael]
Because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want
To give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby 
Oh!

Just promise me, whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

If you can get it
It's worth a try
I really want it
I can't deny
It's just desire
I really love it

[Princess Stphanie of Monaco]
'Cause if it's aching 
You have to rub it 

[Michael]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)
Dare me 
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Aahh, she wants to give it)

[Princess Stphanie of Monaco]
Just open the door
And you will see
This passion burns
Inside of me
Don't say to me
You'll never tell
Touch me there
Make the move
Cast the spell

[Michael]
Because there's something about you, baby 
That makes me want 
To give it to you 
I swear there's something about you, baby 
That makes me want

Just promise me, whatever we say
Or do to each other 
For now, we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

Aaow!

Because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want
To give it to you
Because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want
To give it to you

I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want
To give it to you 
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want
To give it to you 

I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want
To give it to you 
Something about you, baby 
That makes me want

Just promise me, whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now, we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

(She wants to give it)
Dare me
(Aahh)
Keep it in the closet...''''''''''''''''''
