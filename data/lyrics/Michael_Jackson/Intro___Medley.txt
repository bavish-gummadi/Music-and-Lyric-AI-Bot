Song in order of appearance: Scream, They Don't Care About Us, & Scream.
---------------------
Scream:
Tired of injustice
'M tired of these schemes
These lives are disgustin'
So what does it mean? Dabbi
Kickin' me down,
I got ta git up.
As jacked as it sounds,
The whole system sucks. Dabbi

With such confusion don't it make you wanna scream?
Your bash abusin' victimise within the scheme.
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize.
Somebody please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it!

Stop pressurin' on me.
Jus' stop pressurin' on me.
Stop pressurin' on me.
Make me wanna scream.
Stop pressurin' on me.
Jus' stop pressurin' on me.
Stop pressurin' on me.
Make me wanna scream.

I'm tired of ya tellin',
The story your way.
It causes confusion.
You think it's ok. Dabbi
You're changin' the rules,
You're playin' their game.
Can't take it much longer,
I think I might go insane!

Now baby!
With such delusions don't it make you wanna scream?
Your bash abusin' victimise within the scheme.
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize.
Oh father please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it!

Stop pressurin' on me.
Jus' stop pressurin' on me.
Stop pressurin' on me.
Make me wanna scream.
Stop pressurin' on me.
Jus' stop pressurin' on me.
Stop pressurin' on me.
Make me wanna scream.

They don't care about us:
Skinhead, deadhead.
Everybody gone bad.
Situation, aggravation.
Everybody allegation.
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Bang bang, shot dead
Everybody's gone mad

All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us

Tell me what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me.
I'm a victim of police brutality, no.

I'm tired of bein' the victim of hate.
Your rapin' me of my pride
And for G**'s sake
I look to heaven to fulfill this prophecy.
Set me free!

Skinhead, deadhead.
Everybody gone bad.
Trepidation speculation.
Everybody allegation.
In the suite, on the news.
Everybody dog food.
Black man, black mail
Throw the brother in jail

All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us

Hoo!
Everyday, create your history.

Some things in life they just don't wanna see.
But if Martin Luther was livin',
He wouldn't let this be! No no!

All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about ...
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about ...
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us

In The Closet:
Keep it in the closet.
She just a lover,
Who's doin' me by.
It worth the givin'
It's worth the try.
You cannot cleave it,
Put it in the furnace.
You cannot wet it.
You cannot burn it.

(Spoken) One thing in life you must understand,
The truth of lust, woman to man.
So open the door and you will see.
There are no secrets make your move set me free.

Ah, because somethin' about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there somethin' about you baby, oh.

(Spoken) Just promise me
Whatever we say or do to each other
For now we make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

Never give in.''''''''''''''''
