Well well
Well well

If I could tear down these walls
That keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart
And our perfect love will start
But girl you just won't approve
Of the things that I do
When all I do is for you
But still you say it ain't cool
If there's somebody else
(He can't love you like me)
And he says he'll treat you well
(He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls
(He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world
(He can't trick you like me)

So why ain't you feelin' me
(She's invincible)
I can't do anything
(She's invincible)
Even when I beg and plead
(She's invincible)
Girl won't give in to me
(She's invincible)

Now many times I've told you
Of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through
No matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem
That you ain't checking for me
When I know that I could be
More than you could ever dream
If there's somebody else
(He can't love you like me)
And he says he'll treat you well
(He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls
(He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world
(He can't trick you like me)

So why ain't you feelin' me
(She's invincible)
I can't do anything
(She's invincible)
Even when I beg and plead
(She's invincible)
Girl won't give in to me
(She's invincible)

Now some way I'll have to prove
All that I said I would do
Giving you everything
Fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind
And finally give in in time
Then I'll be showing you
What other men are supposed to do for you my baby



Don't mind me --
Stop the frontin' I'm real with mine
All things that I promised I'll fulfill in time
Chains and the bracelets -- got to really shine
So many trips you'll have jet lag and still be fine
He can trade but his money ain't long enough
He can spin but his game ain't strong enough
Now the way you resist me? This ain't cool
It's like nothing chills the girl -- she's invincible

So why ain't you feelin' me -- come around
(She's invincible)
I can't do anything -- come on now
(She's invincible)
Even when I beg and plead -- come on now
(She's invincible)
Girl won't give in to me
(She's invincible)

Why ain't you feelin' me
(She's invincible)
Invincible -- please tell me
(She's invincible)
Invincible
(She's invincible)
You see that girl won't give in to me
(She's invincible)

(She's invincible)
(She's invincible)
(She's invincible)
(She's invincible)

Why ain't you feelin' me
(She's invincible)
I can't do anything
(She's invincible)
Even when I beg and plead
(She's invincible)
Girl won't give in to me
(She's invincible)

She's invincible''''''''''''''''''
