There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming up the stairs

There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

I'm gonna be
Exactly what you wanna see

It's you who's haunting me
Because you're wanting me
To be the stranger
In the night

Am I amusing you
But just confusing me?
Am I the beast
You visualized?
And if you wanna see
Eccentric oddities
I'll be grotesque
Before your eye
Let them all materialize

Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh boy
Is it scary for you big baby
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you big baby

There's a creaking in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is pokin'

I'm gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see

So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before
Your very eyes

A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing
In the night

But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside
A lonely heart
So let the performance start

Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh boy
Am I scary for you big baby
Am I scary for you oh boy
So tell me
Is it scary for you baby
Tell me
So tell me
Is that realism for you big baby
Am I scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for ya

Masquerade the heart
Is the height of hurting souls
Just not what you see of me
Can hardly reveal the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See the evil one is you

Is that scary for you big baby
Am I scary for you oh boy
Am I scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh boy
So tell me
Am I scary for you baby
Am I scary for you baby
Is it scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh boy

Wanna talk about
I wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about
Wanna talk about

Am I scary for you baby
Is that scary for you 
I'm tired of being abused
You know you're scaring me too
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you baby, oh''''''''''''''''''
