Stevie:
Nah na-na na-na-na-na na-nah.

Michael:
Whoo-hoo!
Kissin'! Hee!
Dog-gone lover!

Stevie:
Go-on boy.
Mmmm-hmmm!

Michael:
I watched you on the floor,
Cheek to cheek.
She's getting to you.
You didn't see,
Her eyes on me-no.
She looked right through you.
(Before you make,)
Before you make,
(A big mistake.)
Remember,
That looks can fool you baby, hee!
There's something I would sure appreciate,
(If-a you can keep a secret.)

Baby loves me,
Though she never shows she cares.
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me.)
Baby loves me,
Though she acts like I'm not there,
(That doesn't mean she doesn't love me-Ooh,)
If they ask her,
Tell 'em that we're just good friends.

Dah! Chika-chika-chika-ah!
Just good friends.
Ah! Chika-chika-ah!
(Non-non doo-doo...)
Hee! Aaow!
Just good friends.

Stevie:
You better take advice,
Never trust first impressions.
I tried to hide this affair.
From their suspicions.
So even if she's asking you to stay,
You better know where you stand.

Baby loves me,
Though she never shows she cares.
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me.)
M-ma-baby loves me,
Though she acts like I'm not there,
(That doesn't mean she doesn't love me-Ooh,)
If they ask her,
Tell 'em that we're just good friends.

Yes.
Just good friends.
Root-do-do-do.
Just good friends.

Michael:
Listen up,
Hee!
We've got a problem here.

Stevie:
I can see the signs

Michael:
I guess the lady,

Both:
Is still making up her mind!
(Say we're just good friends)

Stevie:
Baby loves me,
Though she never shows she cares.
No you won't see her kiss and hug me.
(Just good friends)

Michael:
My baby loves me,
Though she acts like I'm not there.
You doggone lover!
Hee!

Stevie:
Aaow!
No-no-no-no-no!
My baby loves me,
Though she never shows she cares.

Michael:
Hee! Hee!

Stevie:
She doesn't kiss and hug me!
(Just good friends)

Michael:
My baby loves me.
She love me, she love me.
Hee! Hee! Hee!
Whoo-hoo!

Stevie:
My baby doesn't see me!
My baby doesn't see me!
My baby doesn't,
Baby doesn't,
Baby doesn't,
Ah!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
(Just good friends)

Michael:
Baby loves me.
She love me, she love me, she love me.
Hee!
Hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
(Non-non doo-doo)
