I watched you on the floor
Cheek to cheek
She's getting to you
You didn't see
Her eyes on me, no
She looked right through you
Before you make
A big mistake remember
That looks can fool you, baby
There's somethin' I would sure appreciate
If you can keep a secret

Baby loves me but she never shows she cares
No, you won't see her kiss and hug me
Baby loves me though she acts like I'm not there
That doesn't mean she doesn't love me ooh
If they ask her tell 'em that we're just good friends
Just good friends
Doot do doo doo
Just good friends

You better take advice
Never trust, first impressions
I tried to hide this affair
From their suspicions
So even if she's askin' you to stay
You better know where you stand

Baby loves me though she never shows she cares
No, you won't see her kiss and hug me
My baby loves me though she acts like I'm not there
That doesn't mean she doesn't love me ooh
Now if they ask you jus' tell 'em that we're just good friends
Yes, just good friends
Root do do do do do doo doo
Just good friends

Listen up
We've got a problem here, I can see the signs
I guess the lady is still makin' up her mind
Say we're just good friends

Baby loves me though she never shows she cares
No you won't see her kiss and hug me
My baby loves me though she acts like I'm not there
You doggone lover
Don't you wanna know?
My Baby loves me though she never shows she cares
She doesn't kiss and hug me
My baby loves me she love me, she love me
(Incomprehensible)
Just good friends
Baby loves me she love me, she love me, she loves me
(Incomprehensible)''''''''''''''''
