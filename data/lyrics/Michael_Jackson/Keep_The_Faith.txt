If you call out loud
Will it get inside
Through the heart of your surrender
To your alibis
And you can say the words
Like you understand
But the power's in believing
So give yourself a chance

'Cause you can
Climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest sea, hee
All you need is the will to want it
And a little self-esteem

So keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round

It's good to go
To get your dreams
Up off the ground
Keep the faith, baby yeah

A matter of time
Before your confidence
Will win out

No matter what it's gonna take
You can be a winner
But you got to keep the faith
...Gonna keep it brother

And when you think of trust
Does it lead you home
To a place that you
Only dream of
When you're all alone
And you can go by feel
'Stead of circumstance
But the power's in believing
So give yourself a chance

I know that you can
Sail across the water
Float across the sky, high
Any road that you take
Will get you there
If you only try

So keep the faith, ow
Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
