She's looking for a job and
To find a place to stay
She's looking for the hope
In the empty promises
She's working two jobs keeping alive
She works in a restaurant night and day
She waits her life away
She wipes the tears away

She cries inside
Every time she feels this way
And she's dying inside
Every time her baby cries

Keeping your head up to the sky
Keeping your mind up stay alive
Gimme your wings so we can fly
(Keep your head up tonight)

Keep your head up the sky
We can just rise up tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly

We're killing up the life in the birds
And the trees
And we're sucking up the air
In the earth from under me
(It's never too late - just lean on me)
I can't even breathe
I can't even see
Keep your head up 
Don't give up today
How long can we wait
I wish the love would come today

Keeping your head up to the sky
Keeping your mind up stay alive
Gimme your wings so we can fly
(Keep your head up tonight)

Keep your head up the sky
We can just rise up tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly

Everybody say that time is borrowed
And hanging down our head
Just ain't no good
And if you dare to rise above tomorrow
Just give yourself a chance
Fight the circumstance
Rise and do it again

Keeping your head up to the sky
Keeping your mind up stay alive
Gimme your wings so we can fly

Keeping your head up to the sky
Keeping your mind up stay alive
Gimme your wings so we can fly
Gimme me your wings so we can fly

I need your love
I need you now
I need your light right here today
I need you now''''''''''''''''''
