I don't care what you talking about, baby 
I don't care what you say 
Don't you come walking, begging back, mama 
I don't care anyway 

Time after time I gave you all of my money 
No excuses to make 
Ain't no mountain that I can't climb, baby 
All is going my way 

'Cause there's a time when you're right 
And you know you must fight 
Who's laughing, baby 
Don't you know 
And there's the choice that we make 
And this choice you will take 
Who's laughing, baby 

So just leave me alone 
Leave me alone 
Leave me alone 
Leave me alone, stop it 
Just stop dogging me around 

There was a time I used to say 
Girl, I need you 
But who is sorry now 
You really hurt 
You used to take and deceive me 
Now who is sorry now 
You got a way of making me feel so sorry 
I found out right away 
Don't you come walking, begging 
I ain't loving you 
Don't you get in my way 

'Cause there's a time when you're right 
And you know you must fight 
Who's laughing, baby 
Don't you know 
And there's the choice that we make 
And this choice you will take 
Who's laughing, baby 

So just leave me alone 
Leave me alone 
Leave me alone 
Leave me alone, stop it 
Just stop dogging me around 

'Cause there's a time when you're right 
And you know you must fight 
Who's laughing, baby 
Don't you know, girl 
And there's the choice that we make 
And this choice you will take 
Who's laughing, baby

So just leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, stop it
Just stop dogging me around

Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, stop it 
Just stop dogging me around 

Don't come begging me
Don't come begging
Don't come loving me
Don't come begging

I love you
I don't want it
I don't, I don't, I don't...

Don't come begging me
Don't come begging
Don't come loving me
Don't come begging

I love you
I don't want it''''''''''''''''''
