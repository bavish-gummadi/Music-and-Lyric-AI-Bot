Ah, I feel a fountain in my brain
Ice-cold water runnin' through my vein
Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart's so sad 'cause love's gone bad

I see a rainbow going black
Must be a sign you ain't comin' back
Wake up at night, callin' your name
I see a face on my window pane

I've been this way since you've been gone
Without your love I can't go on
Look in the mirror, what do I see?
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me
Now where's the love you promised me?
Where's the tenderness to comfort me?

Every time some love I choose
I seem to always be the one to lose
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart's feeling sad 'cause love's gone bad
Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad

Black crows flying up above
It's a sign I live my life without love
Slime's on the land, slime's on the sea
Slime's not the last thing I'm destined to be

In this whole world where there's nothing right
Since you've been gone I can't sleep at night
You said you'd be true to me
Instead you made a fool of me
Heart's feeling sad, love's gone bad

Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad
Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad
Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad
