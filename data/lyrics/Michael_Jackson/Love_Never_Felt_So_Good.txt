Let me see you move...
C'mon!

Let me see you move...

Michael Jackson
Baby, love never felt so good
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh, baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd die if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it, 'cause

Baby, every time I love you
It's in and out of my life, in-out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out my life, in-out baby
So baby, yes, love never felt so good

Justin Timberlake
Oh, baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd doubt if it was ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Ooh baby, love never felt so good (So good)
And I'd doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night through the thick and thin

Michael Jackson
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it, 'cause

Baby, every time I love you
It's in and out my life, in-out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out my life, in-out baby
'Cause baby, love never felt so good

Justin Timberlake
Break it down!
Dance!
Let me see you move...
Let me see you move...
Dance!
Let me see you move, c'mon!

I said, let me see you move...
Michael!

Michael Jackson
And tonight that feels good (feels good)
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it, 'cause

Baby, every time I love you
It's in and out my life, in-out, baby
Tell me, if you really love me
'Cause it's in and out my life, driving me, baby
'Cause baby, love never felt so good

Baby, every time I love you
It's in and out my life, in-out, baby
Tell me, if you really love me
'Cause it's in and out my life, driving me, baby
'Cause baby, love never felt so good

Never felt so good, oh
It never felt so good
Never felt so... no
It never felt so good
Never felt so, yeah, yeah
It never felt so good
Oh, oh!
It never felt so good

All right that's fine...''''''''''''''''''
