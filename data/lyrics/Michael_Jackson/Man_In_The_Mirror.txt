I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right...

As I, turn up the collar on my
Favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone

A widow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed - out dream
(Washed - out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya' see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Change his ways - ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that...
Change!

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror - oh yeah!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
(You gotta get it right, while
You got the time)
('Cause when you close your heart)
You can't close your... your mind!
(Then you close your... mind!)

That man
(With the man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Na na na, na na na, na na na nah
(Oh yeah!)
Gonna feel real good now!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Na na na, na na na, na na na nah

(Ooooh...)
Oh no, no, no...
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good
Come on
(Change...)

Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it
Yourself!
(Yeah! - make that change!)
I've got to make that change
Today!
Hoo!
(Man in the mirror)

You got to
You got to not let yourself...
Brother...
Hoo!
(Yeah! - make that change!)
You know - I've got to get
That man, that man...
(Man in the mirror)
You've got to
You've got to move!
Come on! Come on!
You got to
Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
(Yeah! - make that change!)
Stand up and lift yourself, now!
(Man in the mirror)
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Aaow!
(Yeah, make that change)
Gonna make that change...
Come on!
(Man in the mirror)
You know it!
You know it!
You know it!
You know...
(Change...)
Make that change''''''''''''''''''''
