Money!

Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it

So you call it trust but I say it's just
In the devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do me for the money
They don't care, they use me for the money

So you go to church, read the holy word
In the scheme of life it's all absurd
They don't care, they'd kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money

You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge, you're called the "Just Few"
And you're fighting the wars a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but...

If you show me the cash then I will take it
If you tell me to cry then I will fake it
If you give me a hand then I will shake it
You'll do anything for money

Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you, would die for you, ah
Even sell my soul to the devil, ah

Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you, would die for you, ah
Even sell my soul to the devil

Insurance? Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money

Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul 'cause your God is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money

Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttoney and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles, the idle jabbers...
'Cause they're the backstabbers

If you know it's a lie then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance then you will dare it
You'll do anything for money

Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you, would die for you, ah
Even sell my soul to the devil, ah

Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you, would die for you, ah
Even sell my soul to the devil

Anything, anything (Hoo!)
Anything for money
Would lie for you, would die for you, ah
Even sell my soul to the devil, ah

Anything, anything (Hoo!)
Anything for money
Would lie for you, would die for you, ah
Even sell my soul to the devil

You say you wouldn't do it for all the money in the world
I don't think so

If you show me the man then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie then I will tell him
If you're stealing with God then you will hell him
You'll do anything for money

Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you, would die for you, ah
Even sell my soul to the devil, ah

Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you, would die for you, ah
Even sell my soul to the devil

Would lie for you, would die for you, ah
Even sell my soul to the devil, ah (Anything, anything)

Anything, anything (Hoo!)
Anything for money (Hoo!)
Would lie for you, would die for you, ah
Even sell my soul to the devil

Anything, anything (You thought it, You thought it)
Anything for money (You thought it, You thought!)
Would lie for you, would die for you, ah (You thought it, You thought it)
Even sell my soul to the devil, ah (You want it, You want it, You want it, Oww!)

Anything, anything (Hoo!)
Anything for money
Would lie for you, would die for you, ah (Go tell it, Go tell it)
Even sell my soul to the devil (Selling to my devil!)''''''''''''''''''
