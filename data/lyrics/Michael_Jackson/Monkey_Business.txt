Well, Lord have mercy
Well, Lord have mercy
This ain't no good for me
This ain't no good for me, babe
Well, Lord have mercy
Well, Lord have mercy
Ain't no good for me, babe
Tell me what's goin' down, babe

Every time I wanna say it, it is just too much for me
I don't ever wanna say it cause of all the blasphemy
Everybody's doin' it to somebody's love in sight of me
I might tell on you
Don't you start no stuff with me

Your brother's gone and kissed the mother-in-law
I might tell Dad about what I saw
Oh, no
I caught your mother, she's doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm lookin' right at you
Stop it, it's too much
Monkey business goin' down

Well, Lord have mercy
Well, Lord have mercy
Don't be callin' out "mercy me"
(Don't be callin' out "mercy me")
Don't be callin' down, babe
(Don't be callin' out mercy)
Well, Lord have mercy
Even burst the breast
Don't be callin' out "mercy me"
(Don't be callin' out "mercy me")
Don't be goin' down, babe
(Don't be callin' out "mercy")

Every time I wanna say it, it is just too much for me
Everybody's doin' it to somebody's love it seems to me
I just can't believe the things I'm seein', so just let it be
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me

Your brother's gone and kissed the mother-in-law
I might tell Dad about what I saw
Oh, no
I caught your mother, she's doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm lookin' right at you
No, baby, too much
Monkey business goin' down

I read the paper and I can't believe what's goin' round
Somebody's doin' it to somebody's up, somebody's down
The government won't pay my taxes and I'm really mad
My mouth might let it be
So don't you monkey shy with me

Your brother's gone and kissed the mother-in-law
I might tell Dad about what I saw
Oh, no
I caught your mother, she's doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm lookin' right at you
Oh, no, you're dirty, you're dirty babe dirty babe

Your brother's gone and kissed the mother-in-law
I might tell Dad about what I saw
Oh, no
Your brother didn't make a nickel, or dime too
Sittin' around tellin' how he did it to you
Stop it, it's too much
Monkey business goin' down
