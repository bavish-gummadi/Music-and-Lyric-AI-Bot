Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show

Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so?

That I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no
Never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
I start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
That passes me right through the core

It says turn around, you fool
You know you'll love her more and more
Tell me why is it so?
Don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, ooh, baby
I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh

Oh, I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, ooh, I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh

Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no
Never can say goodbye

I keep thinkin' that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
And there's that anguish, there's that doubt

It's that same old, did you hang up?
Can't do with you all the time
Tell me why is it so?
Don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, ooh, baby, I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh

Oh, I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh

Oh, I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, ooh, baby, I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh, ooh

I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, ooh, oh, no, I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh''''''''''''''''
