Calling on the Night Line
Waking me up
Calling on the Night Line (Calling on the Night Line)
Can't get enough
Calling on the Night Line (Calling on the Night Line)
Whisper in my ear
Sending through the fire line (Calling on the Night Line)
What I'd like to hear

Every night about midnight
The call comes through
You turn it on the Night Line
'Cause you know just what to do
And I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
By the phone (By the phone) Alone.

Calling on the Night Line
Waking me up (Call me, baby)
Calling on the Night Line - Hee!
Can't get enough (Call me, darling)
Calling on the Night Line - Hee!
Whisper in my ear - Aow!
Sending through the fire line
What I'd like to hear

Make it person-to-person
Make it heart-to-heart
Darling, your communication
Is sending up sparks
I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
By the phone (By the phone)
Why don't you give me a call?

(Calling on the Night Line
Getting me up)
I wanna call
(Calling on the Night Line
Can't get enough)
Why don't you call me, baby? Hee!
Call me on the Night Line! (Call me, darling!)
Whisper in my ear (Won't you call me, baby!) Hee!
Sending through the fire line
What I'd like to hear - Ooh!

(Call me on the Night Line)
(Call me on the Night Line)
(Call me on the Night Line)
(Call me on the Night Line) Ooh!

Calling on the Night Line
Waking me up - Oh!
Calling on the Night Line - Hee!
Can't get enough (Call me, baby!)
Calling on the Night Line
Whisper in my ear
Sending through the fire line
What I'd like to hear

Calling on the Night Line
Getting me up - Oh!
Call me on the Night Line - Hee!
Can't get enough (Call me, baby!)
Calling on the Night Line
Whisper in my ear
Sending through the fire line
What I'd like to hear''''''''''''''''
