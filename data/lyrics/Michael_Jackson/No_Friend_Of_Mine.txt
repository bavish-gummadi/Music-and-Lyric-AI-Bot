(Tempamental)

U not my girl
U not my wife
Got a couple tips from Mike
I'm moonwalkin outcha life
I close my eyes, you outta site
Now she wanna call me conceited
'Cause I'm a Smooth Criminal
I told her to Beat It
When a lil' love was all I needed
U talkin'? I call it how I see it
And now I mean it
I'm out for good
Like a lot of you into movin out the hood
But if I told you take me back you would
Too late me and P like Pac and Suge
Had you into cars with a metro
With a couple superstar from the ghetto
Now you feelin' so soft and you let go
Of da T.E.M.P.A Mental

(Michael Jackson)

What you gonna do
U ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
I'm the new Gangsta

What you gonna do
U ain't no friend of mine
I can never fall in love
The new Gangsta

What you gonna do
U ain't no friend of mine
(Whatchu Gooooonnnnnna Do)
Look what you put me through

What you gonna doooo
U ain't no friend of mine
I can never fall in love
The new Gangsta

(Pras)

U ain't no friend
A friend u'll neva be
Obviously never been wit a real OG
From the H.I.T rollin' B.I.G
Passin through V.I.P it's the Refugee
(Gangsta)
Spread some love like the Gold Rush
Is was the things you did that used to mean so much
Whatever you touched
The way you used to blush
Now me you brush


Don't believe in such
Not since lovers don't promote violence
Not since just like the dolla no sense
No good I can feel it through my sixth sense
What's this wanna suck my existence
But still I believe in you and Me
Quite frankly that's how it's supposed to be
That kinda love that could end any poverty
So I keep these ghost like the Kennedy's
Yeah

(Michael Jackson)
