When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feeling, huh
Then there ain't no room for you this part of town

'Cause we're the party people night and day
Living crazy, that's the only way

So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall

Life ain't so bad at all (live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (live it off the wall)

You can shout out all you want to
Cause there ain't no sin in folks all getting loud
If you take the chance and do it, hup
Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down

'Cause we're the party people night and day
Living crazy, that's the only way

So tonight gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (c'mon and groove)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall

Life ain't so bad at all (live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (live it off the wall)

Do what you want to do
There ain't no rules it's up to you (ain't no rules it's all up to you)
It's time to come alive
And party all right through the night (all right)

Gotta hide your inhibitions
Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul
Want to see an exhibition, hup
Better do it now before you get too old

'Cause we're the party people night and day
Living crazy, that's the only way

So tonight gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall

Life ain't so bad at all (live it off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (so)

Tonight gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (c'mon and groove)
Groove (yeah) let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall

Tonight (live it off the wall)
Gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf
(Life ain't bad at all, live it off the wall))
And just enjoy yourself (life ain't bad at all)
Come on and groove, yeah (live it off the wall)
Let the madness in the music get to you
(Life ain't bad at all, live it off the wall)
Life ain't so bad at all (wanna live)

Tonight (live it off the wall)
Gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf
(Life ain't bad at all, live it off the wall))
And just enjoy yourself (life ain't bad at all)
Come on and groove, yeah (live it off the wall)
Let the madness in the music get to you
(Life ain't bad at all, live it off the wall)
Life ain't so bad at all''''''''''''''''
