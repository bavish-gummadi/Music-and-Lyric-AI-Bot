Baby
Now I'm mad
The world treats me like an everyday dump
They call me names, threaten my family
And I always say

On my anger
On my anger
Tonight
On my anger
On my anger
It's gonna be a bite

Honey
What you do to me
You strike me like a lightning bolt
And
Baby
Won't you stay for awhile
Cause fame is treating me insane

On my anger
On my anger
Tonight
On my anger
On my anger
It's gonna be a bite

On my anger
On my anger
Tonight
On my anger
On my anger
It's gonna be a bite

And now I'm trying to move on
Though it feels like nobody loves me
And now I'm all beat up
By the gangster down the street!

On my anger
On my anger
Tonight
On my anger
On my anger
It's gonna be a bite

On my anger
On my anger
Tonight
On my anger
On my anger
It's gonna be a bite''''''''''''''''
