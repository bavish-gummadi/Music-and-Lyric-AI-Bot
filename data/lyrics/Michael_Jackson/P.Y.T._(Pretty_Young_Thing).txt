You know you, you make me feel so good inside
I always wanted a girl just like you
Such a P.Y.T., pretty young thing, ooh!

Where did you come from lady?
And ooh won't you take me there?
Right away, won't you baby?
Tendoroni you've got to be
Spark my nature, sugar fly with me

Don't you know now is the perfect time
We can make it right, hit the city lights
Then tonight ease the lovin' pain
Let me take you to the max!

I want to love you
(P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin'
(T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there, girl, hoo!

I want to love you
(P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin'
(T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
I'll take you there
(Anywhere you wanna go)
Yes, I will, ooh!

Nothin' can stop this burnin' desire to be with you
Gotta get to you baby
Won't you come? It's emergency
Cool my fire yearnin', honey, come set me free

But don't you know now is the perfect time
We can dim the lights, just to make it right
In the night, hit the lovin' spot
I'll give you all that I've got

I want to love you
(P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin'
(T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
Yes, I will, yes I

I want to love you
(P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin'
(T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
I'll take you there
Yes, I will, hee!

Pretty young things, repeat after me
Sing na na na, na na na
Na na-na na, na na-na na
Sing, na na na, na na na
Na-na na-na na, na-na na-na na
I'll take you there, take you there

I want to love you
(P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin'
(T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
Take you there, take you there

I want to love you
(P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin'
(T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
Take you there
