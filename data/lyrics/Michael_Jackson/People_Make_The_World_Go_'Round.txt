People... 
('Round and 'round and around...)
People make the world go 'round
('Round and 'round and around...)

Teachers on strike, no more school today
They want more money but the board won't pay
People
Everybody's talkin' 'bout ecology
The air's so polluted that it's hard to breathe
People

But that's what makes the world go round
The ups and downs a carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground young men...
People make the world go round...

Old folks judge you by the clothes you wear
They'd swear you're a hippy if you have long hair
Young politicians fight for poverty
While people still cry for equality

But that's what makes the world go round
The ups and downs a carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground young men...
People make the world go round...

But that's what makes the world go round
The ups and downs a carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground young men...
People make the world go round...'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
