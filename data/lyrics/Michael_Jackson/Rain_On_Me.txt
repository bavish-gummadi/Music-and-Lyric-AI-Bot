Aaow! hee hee hee

I ain't talkin' about all your lovin'. I just Wanna get out.
Why won't you just give me some time alone baby.
You just keep foolin' me.

I don't no why I get on this feelin' (baby).
I don't no why.

You won't stop throwin' rain on me. You just won't stop it.
You keep on throwin' rain on me (rain on me baby).
You can't tell me why.

Why hee hee

I ain't thinkin' about danger or lovin'

I just Wanna get out. Why won't you just give me some
Time alone baby. Why I keep foolin' myself

I don't no why I get on this feelin' (baby)
I don't no why.

(Chrous)

You won't stop throwin' rain on me.
You just won't stop yourself. You keep on
Throwin' rain on me (rain on me baby).
You can't tell me why.

(Fade out)''''''''''''''''
