(Malachi)
Knew it from the day I met you were the one
But I guess I let you know too soon
'Cause now every day you want to bring it up
Stressing me to settle down with you

You know it's getting on my nerves
It's like you never hear a single word
Listen close to me
You'll be the first to know, girl, once I'm ready

I don't wanna go (go) I don't wanna stay (stay)
Think I need a little time away
Hope you understand (why) this is what I need (so)
Give me some room to breathe
Only then I'll know (know) what I gotta do (do)
'Cause right now I'm only hurting you
Hope you understand (why) this is what I need (so)
Give me some room to breathe

Sometimes you need to step outside the game
If you want to win it in the end
'Cause I'm down for you until we share my name [yes I am]
So you need to stop the questioning

(And you know that) You know it's getting on my nerves [oh yeah]
It's like you never hear a single word [yeah]
Listen close to me
You'll be the first to know, girl, once I'm ready

I don't wanna go (go) I don't wanna stay (stay)
Think I need a little time away [time away]
Hope you understand (why) this is what I need (so)
Give me some room to breathe [to breathe]
Only then I'll know (know) what I gotta do (do)
'Cause right now I'm only hurting you [hurting you]
Hope you understand (why) this is what I need (so)
Give me some room to breathe

Better believe a little distance will only bring me closer to you
And I know it might be hard for you to hear, but here's what we've gotta do
We need to take a little time to see what is meant to be
So just give me some room to breathe

I don't wanna go (go) I don't wanna stay (stay)
Think I need a little time away [think I need a little time]
Hope you understand (why) this is what I need (so)
Give me some room to breathe
Only then I'll know (know) what I gotta do (do)
'Cause right now I'm only hurting you [yeah]
Hope you understand (why) this is what I need (so)
Give me some room to breathe

(I thought I told you girl)
(I got to get some room)
(Yeah babe)
(Oh)
(Just give me some room)''''''''''''''''
