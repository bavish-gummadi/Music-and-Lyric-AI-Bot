Alone she lays waiting
Surrounded by gloom
Inflated by shadows
Painting the room
The light from the window
Cuts trough the air
And pins the child lying there
Scared of the moon

She pulls up the curtain
And shivers in fright
She hides from the colours
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her moanfull cry
Scared of the moon

There's nothing wrong
Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry 
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering
Scared of the moon

Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon

The years go by swiftly
And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child 
Still intrude the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon

The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy 
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful tone
Scared of the moon

But now there are others who sit here alone 
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
The loners see shade 
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon

Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon''''''''''''''''''
