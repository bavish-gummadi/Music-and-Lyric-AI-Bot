Tired of injustice, tired of the schemes
The lies are disgusting so what does it mean
Kicking me down, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds, the whole system sucks

Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but I care about mine
I've got to get stronger and I won't give up the fight

With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream
(Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize)
Somebody please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make you just wanna scream

Tired of you tellin'
The story your way
It's causin' confusion
You think it's okay

You keep changin' the rules
While I keep playin' the game
I can't take it much longer
I think I might go insane

With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream
(Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(You find your pleasure scandalizin' every lie)
Oh father please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop fuckin' with me
Make me wanna scream

Oh my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV 
This evening, i was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice (all the injustice)

With such delusions don't it make you wanna scream
(Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize)
Oh brother, please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream''''''''''''''''''''
