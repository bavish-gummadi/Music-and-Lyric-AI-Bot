Huuuuu
Oooow
Iiiih

Tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
Life is disgustin'
So what does it mean, damnit
Kicking me down
I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damnit

Peek in the shadow
Come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but
I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

With such confusions
Don't it make you wanna scream
(Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin'
Victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me


Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream

Tired of your tellin'
(Tellin')
The story your way
(The story your way)
It's causin' confusion
(Confusion)
You think it's okay, damnit

Keep changin' the rules
While you're playin' the game
I can't take it much longer
I think I might go insane

Now, baby
With such confusion
Don't it make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin'
Victimize with''''''''''''''''''
