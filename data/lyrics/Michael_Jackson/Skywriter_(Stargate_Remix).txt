Sweep your silver pen across the sky so high

Sweep your silver pen across the sky so high

She don't read the letters I write anymore
Sorry, I upset her but I wasn't sure
I know I love her, I hope that she will see
A message high above her that you write for me, yeah

Send her box of candy and flowers everyday
Still she wouldn't listen, her pride got in the way
Now it's up to you, it won't fade away
Write it on the heavens, love will make it stay, yeah
