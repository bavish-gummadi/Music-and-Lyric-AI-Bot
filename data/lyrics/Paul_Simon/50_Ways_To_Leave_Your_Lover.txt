"The problem is all inside your head," she said to me
"The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover"

She said, "It's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover"
50 ways to leave your lover

You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free

Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

Ooh, just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me 

Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

She said, "It grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again"
I said, "I appreciate that and would you please explain
About the fifty ways?"

She said why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover
50 ways to leave your lover

You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free

Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

Slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me

Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free''''''''''''''''''
