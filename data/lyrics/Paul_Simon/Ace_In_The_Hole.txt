Some people say Jesus that's the ace in
The hole
But I never met the man so I don't
Really know
Maybe some Christmas If I'm sick
And alone
He will look up my number
Call me on the phone and say
Hey, boy, where you been so long
Don't you know me
I'm your ace in the hole

Two hundred dollars, that's my ace in
The hole
When I'm down. dirty and desperate
That's my emergency bank roll (I got...)
Two hundred dollars, that's the price on
The street
If you wanna get some quality
That's the price you got to meet (and the
Man says,)
Hey, Junior, where you been so long
Don't you know me
I'm your ace in the hole
(Talk about ace in the hole)

Once I was crazy and my ace in the hole
Was that I knew that I was crazy
So I never lost my self-control
I just walk in the middle of the road
I sleep In the middle of the bed
I stop In the middle of a sentence
And the voice in the middle of my head said
Hey, junior, where you been so long
Don't you know me
I'm your ace in the hole (oh yeah)

Ace In the hole
Lean on me
Don't you know me
I'm your guarantee

Riding on this rolling bus
Beneath a stormy sky
With a slow moon rising
And the smokestacks drifting by
In the hour when the heart is weakest
And the memory Is strong
When time has stopped
But the bus Just rolls along

Roll on, roll on
Roll on. roll on
Roll on, roll on

Some people say music that's their ace in
The hole
Just your ordinary rhythm and blues
Your basic rock and roll
You can sit on the top of the beat
You can lean on the side of the beat
You can hang from the bottom of the beat
But you got to admit that the music is sweet

Where you been so long
Don't you know me
I'm your ace in the hole (oh yeah)

Ace in the hole
Lean on me
Don't you know me
I'm your guarantee

Some people say music that's their ace in
The hole
Just your ordinary rhythm and blues
Your basic rock and roll
You can sit on the top of the beat
You can lean on the side of the beat
You can hang from the bottom of the beat
But you gotta admit that the music is sweet

Hey, junior. I'm your ace In the hole
Hey. junior, I'm your ace in the hole
Hey, junior, I'm your ace in the hole
Hey, junior, I'm your ace In the hole''''''''''''''''''
