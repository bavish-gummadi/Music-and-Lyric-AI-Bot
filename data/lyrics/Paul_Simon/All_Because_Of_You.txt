I went to my doctor
I said
Give me some relief
He said
Tell me what's the matter with you, boy...
I said
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because you wouldn't say, I do

So I went to my drugstore
I said
Do the drugs on me...
He said
Oh, what can you do
When it's all because of you
You know, it's all because you wouldn't say, I do 

Ain't nobody loves me
Nobody needs my love
This is my only life
(...)

Holy Moses, what's this goin' on
I said
I can't believe it's true
Brain's all messed up, can't be straight
And it's all because of you
That's right, it's all because of you
Yes, it's all because of you
It's all because you would not say we're through 

So I went to the gypsy woman
I said
Give me some relief
She said
I ain't got no potions and no special kind of weed
She said
I'll tell you what to do
She said, I'll tell you what to do,
She said, go away, take a week or two

I ain't got nobody
Ever since you been gone
Love is an...
Going away, another lover
Is an easy game
I won the same way too 

Said it's all because of you
All because of you
All because of you
All

All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I said
It's all because of you
All because of you
That's right, it's all because of you''''''''''''''''''
