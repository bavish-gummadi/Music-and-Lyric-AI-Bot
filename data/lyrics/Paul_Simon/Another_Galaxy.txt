On the morning of her wedding day
When no one was awake
She drove across the border
Leaving all the yellow roses
On her wedding cake
Her mother's tears, her breakfast order
She's gone, gone, gone

There is a moment
A chip in time
When leaving home
Is the lesser crime
When your eyes are blind with tears
But your heart can see:
Another life
Another galaxy

That night her dreams are storm-tossed as a willow
She hears the clouds, she sees the eye of a hurricane
As it sweeps across her island pillow
But she's gone, gone, gone

There is a moment
A chip in time
When leaving home
Is the lesser crime
When your eyes are blind with tears
But your heart can see:
Another life
Another galaxy''''''''''''''''''
