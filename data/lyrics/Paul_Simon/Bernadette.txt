Whoa------I got time on my hands tonight
You're the girl of my dreams
When I'm near you my future seems bright

Ooh------I want you to be my girl
I want you to be my movie
I am Sal Mineo and I need you so
Sweet Bernadette

Whoa------You got style from your hair to your heels
Though my words may be jumbled
Still I'm telling you just how it feels

I love you

Sal and bernadette
I love you
And the breeze that wraps around you

SAL
Satin summer nights

Bernadette
Satin summer nights

Sal and bernadette
A girl I can't forget

SAL
Whoa------You're the smile of the moon Bernadette

Sal and bernadette
Dom Dom Dom Doo
Well-a well I'm home
Dom Dom Dom Doo
Well-a well I'm home

SAL
Wop, Wop, Wop, Wop
Come with me
There's a place I want you to see

When the leaves are dark
I've got a hiding place in Central Park
And the sky is a coat of diamonds

There's a wooden cross over my bed
The city is lit with candles
They're shining for you Bernadette.

Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
Ooh Ooh, Bernadette

Sal and bernadette
Dom Dom Dom Doo
Well-a well I'm home
Dom Dom Dom Doo
Well-a well I'm home


SAL
Wop, Wop, Wop, Wop, Wop.''''''''''''''''''
