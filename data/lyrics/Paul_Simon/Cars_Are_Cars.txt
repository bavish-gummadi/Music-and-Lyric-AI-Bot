Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Similarly made. Similarly sold
In a motorcade. Abandoned when they're old
Cars are cars all over the world

Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Engine in the front. Jack in the back
Wheels take the brunt. Pinion and a rack
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world

But people are strangers
They change with the curve
From time zone to time zone
As we can observe
They shut down their borders
And think they're immune
They stand on their differences
And shoot at the moon

But cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Drive 'em on the left. Drive 'em on the right
Susceptible to theft in the middle of the night
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world

I once had a car
That was more like a home
I lived in it, loved in it
Polished its chrome
If some of my homes
Had been more like my car
I probably wouldn't have
Travelled this far

Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world''''''''''''''''''
