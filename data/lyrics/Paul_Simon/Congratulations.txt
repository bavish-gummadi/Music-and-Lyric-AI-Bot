Congratulations
Oh, seems like you've done it again
And I ain't had such misery
Since I don't know when
Oh, and I don't know when, oh, and I don't know when

I notice so many people
Slipping away
And many more waiting in the lines
In the courtrooms today
Oh, in the courtrooms today

Love is not a game
Love is not a toy
Love's no romance
Love will do you in
And love will wash you out
And needless to say
You won't stand a chance, you won't stand a chance
I'm hungry for learning
Won't you answer me please
Can a man and a woman
Live together in peace,
Oh, live together in peace?''''''''''''''''''
