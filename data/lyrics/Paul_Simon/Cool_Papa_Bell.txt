It turns out to be a great thing for me
I don't worry and I don't think
Because it's not my job to worry or to think
Not me, I'm more like

Every day I'm here, I'm grateful
And that's the gist of it
Now you may call that a bogus
Bullshit, New Age point of view

But check out my tattoo says Wall-to-Wall Fun
Does everyone know everyone? Mr. Wall-to-Wall Fun
Meet Dr. Well, Well, Well and Cool Papa Bell
The fastest man on Earth did dwell as Cool Papa Bell

Motherfucker, ugly word
Ubiquitous and often heard
As a substitute for someone's Christian name
And I think, yeah the word is ugly, all the same

Ugly got a case to make
It's not like every rodent gets a birthday cake
No, it's, You're a chipmunk, how cute is that?
But you, you motherfucker, are a filthy rat

And well, well, well
Is it true, Papa Bell
That the beauties go to heaven
And the ugly go to hell
Cool Papa Bell

Have you all heard the news: Heaven Finally Found
Ok, it's six trillion light years away
But we're all gonna get there someday
Yes, we're all gonna get there one day
We all gonna get, we all gonna get, we...

But, but not you, you stay and explain
The suffering and the pain you caused
The thrill you feel when evil dreams come true

And check out my tattoo it says Wall-to-Wall Fun
Does everyone know everyone? Mr. Wall-to-Wall Fun
Meet Dr. Well, Well, Well and Cool Papa Bell
The fastest man on Earth did dwell as Cool Papa Bell

And you're never gonna stop him
Never gonna stop, never gonna stop him
I'm never gonna stop, you never gonna
Never gonna stop, never gonna stop
No, no you never gonna stop, never gonna stop''''''''''''''''''''
