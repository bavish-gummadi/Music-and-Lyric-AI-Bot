The first time I saw her
I couldn't be sure
But the sin of impatience
Said "She's just what you're looking for"
So I walked right up to her
And with the part of me that talks
I introduced myself as Frank
From New York, New York

She's so hot
She's so cool
I'm not
I'm just a fool in love with Darling Lorraine

All my life I've been a wanderer
Not really, I mostly lived near my parents home
Anyway Lorraine and I got married
And the usual marriage stuff
Then one day she says to me
From out of the blue
She says, "Frank, I've had enough
Romance is a heartbreaker
I'm not meant to be a homemaker
And I'm tired of being Darling Loraine"

What? You don't love me anymore?
What? You're walking out the door?
What? You don't like the way I chew?
Hey, let me tell you
You're not the woman that I wed
You say you're depressed but you're not
You just like to stay in bed
I don't need you darling Lorraine
Darling Lorraine
Lorraine
I long for your love

Financially speaking
I guess I'm a washout
Everybody's buy and sell
And sell and buy
And what's what the whole thing's all about
If it had not been Lorraine
I'd have left here long ago
I should have been a musician
I love the piano

She's so light
She's so free
I'm tight,
Well, that's me
But I feel so good
With Darling Lorraine

On Christmas morning Frank awakes
To find Lorraine has made a stack of pancakes
They watch the television, husband and wife
All afternoon "It's a wonderful life"

What? You don't love me anymore?
What? You're walking out the door?
What? You don't like the way I chew?
Hey, let me tell you
You're not the woman that I wed
Gimme my robe, I'm going back to bed
I'm sick to death of you Lorraine

Darling Lorraine
Lorraine
Her hands like wood
The doctor was smiling
But the news wasn't good

Darling Lorraine
Please don't leave me yet
I know you're in pain
Pain you can't forget
Your breathing is like an echo of our love
Maybe I'll go down to the corner store
And buy us something sweet
Here's an extra blanket honey
To wrap around your feet
All the trees were washed with April rain
And the moon in the meadow
Took darling Lorraine''''''''''''''''''''
