(a-wa) O kodwa u zo-nge li-sa namhlange
(a-wa a-wa) Si-bona kwenze ka kanjani
(a-wa a-wa) Amanto mbazane ayeza

She's a rich girl
She don't try to hide it
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes
He's a poor boy
Empty as a pocket
Empty as a pocket with nothing to lose
Sing ta na na
(Ta na na)
Ta na na na
She got diamonds on the soles of her shoes
Ta na na
(Ta na na)
Ta na na na
She got diamonds on the soles of her shoes
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes (Rich girl)
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes

People say she's crazy
She got diamonds on the soles of her shoes
Well, that's one way to lose these walking blues
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes

She was physically forgotten
But then she slipped into my pocket with my car keys
She said, "You've taken me for granted because I please you
Wearing these diamonds"

And I could say Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
As if everybody knows what I'm talking about
As if everybody here would know exactly what I was talking about
Talking about diamonds on the soles of her shoes

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

She makes the sign of a teaspoon, he makes the sign of a wave
The poor boy changes clothes, and he puts on aftershave
To compensate for his ordinary shoes

And she said, "Honey, take me dancing"
But they ended up by sleeping in a doorway
By the bodegas and the lights on upper Broadway
Wearing diamonds on the soles of their shoes

And I could say Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
And everybody here would know what I was talking about
I mean, everybody here would know exactly what I was talking about
I'm talking about diamonds

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

People say I'm crazy, I got diamonds on the soles of my shoes, yeah
Well, that's one way to lose these walking blues
Diamonds on the soles of our shoes
