M-m, paraphernalia
Never hides your broken bones
And I don't know why
You want to try
Mm, It's plain to see you're on your own
Uh, huh, I ain't blind, no
Some folks are crazy
Others walk that borderline
Watch what you're doing
Taking downs to get off to sleep
And ups to start you on your way
After a while they'll change your style
M-m-m, I see it happening every day
Uh, huh spare your heart
Everything put together
Sooner or later falls apart
There's nothing to it, nothing to it
You can cry
You can lie
For all the good it'll do you 
You can die
But when it's done
And the police come, and they lay you down for dead
Uh, huh, just remember what I said''''''''''''''''''
