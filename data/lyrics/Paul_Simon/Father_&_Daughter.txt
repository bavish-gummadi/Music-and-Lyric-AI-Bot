From The Wild Thornberrys Movie soundtrack

If you leap awake
In the mirror of a bad dream
And for a fraction of a second
You can't remember where you are
Just open your window
And follow your memory upstream
To the meadow in the mountain
Where we counted every falling star

I believe the light that shines on you
Will shine on you forever (forever)
And though I can't guarantee
There's nothing scary hiding under your bed
I'm gonna stand guard like a postcard of a golden retriever
And never leave till I leave you with a sweet dream in your bed

I'm gonna watch you shine
Gonna watch you grow
Gonna paint a sign
So you'll always know
As long as one and one is two
There could never be a father who loved his daughter more than I love you

Trust your intuition
It's just like goin' fishin'
You cast your line and hope you get a bite

But you don't need to waste your time
Worryin' about the market place
Try to help the human race
Strugglin to survive its harshest night.''&''&''&''&''&''&''&''&''&
