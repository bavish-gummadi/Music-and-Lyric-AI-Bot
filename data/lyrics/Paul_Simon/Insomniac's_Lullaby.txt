Oh Lord, don't keep me up all night
Side by side with the moon
With its desolate eyes
Miles from the sunrise
The darkness inviting a tune
The Insomniac's Lullaby

A siren is playing its song in the distance
The melody rattles the old window frame
Gradually, angels reveal their existence
And there's nothing and no one to blame

Oh Lord, don't keep me up all night
Side by side with the moon
Alone in the bed
The season ahead
Is winter that lasts until June
The Insomniac's Lullaby

Sleep

They say all roads lead to a river
Then one day
The river comes up to your door
How will the builder of bridges deliver us all
To the faraway shore

Oh Lord, don't keep me up all night
With questions I can't understand
While I wrestle my fears
The sound in my ears
Is the music that's sweeping the land
The Insomniac's Lullaby

Sleep

Soft as a rose
The light from the East
As if all is forgiven
And wolves become sheep
We are who we are
Or we're not
But at least
We'll eventually all fall asleep
Eventually all fall asleep'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
