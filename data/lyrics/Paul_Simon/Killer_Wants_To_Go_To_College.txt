Inmate
Killer wants to go to college
He wants to get his parole
So the Department of Corrections
Will release him in the fall
Killer wants to go on TV
Wants to talk about his book
Make my life into a movie
I got the style, I got the look.

Virgil
This boy used to be on death-row
Will his violence return?
Will he call out to his mother,
'Mama, you can watch me burn!'

Inmate
Killer wants to go to college
Another bullshit degree
Tell the little town of New Paltz
'You ain't got nothin' to be scared about with me'''''''''''''''''''
