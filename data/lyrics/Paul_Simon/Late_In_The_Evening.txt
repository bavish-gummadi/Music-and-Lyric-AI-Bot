First thing I remember, I was lying in my bed
Couldn't have been no more than one or two
And I remember there was a radio 
Coming from the room next door
And my mother laughed the way some ladies do
Well it's late in the evening 
And the music's seeping through

The next thing I remember, I am walking down the street 
I'm feeling all right, I'm with my boys, I'm with my troops, yeah
And down along the avenue some guys are shootin' pool
And I heard the sound of acapella grooves, yeah
Singin' late in the evening
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah

Then I learned to play some lead guitar
I was underage in this funky bar 
And I stepped outside and smoked myself a J
And when I come back to the room everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play
And it was late in the evening
And I blew that room away

The first thing I remember when you came into my life
I said, "I'm gonna get that girl no matter what I do"
Well I guess I've been in love before
Once or twice I've been on the floor
But I never loved no one the way that I love you
And it was late in the evening 
And all the music seeping through.''''''''''''''''''''
