You got the cool water
When the fever runs high
You got the look of love light
In your eyes
And I was in crazy motion
Till you calmed me down
It took a little time
But you calmed me down

Whoa, let me live in your city
The river's so pretty
The air is so fine, mm
Rent me a room
Where I can lay over, oh
I'm just a traveler
Eatin' up travelin' time, mm
I'm just a traveler
Eatin' up my travelin' time

They got a wall in China
It's a thousand miles long
To keep out the foreigners
They built it strong
And I got a wall around me
You can't even see
It took a little time
To get to me

Whoa, let me live in your city
The river's so pretty
The air is so fine, mm
Rent me a room
Where I can lay over, oh
I'm just a traveler
Eatin' up travelin' time, whoa
I'm just a traveler
Eatin' up my travelin' time

Some people never say the words "I love you"
It's not their style to be so bold
Some people never say those words "I love you"
But like a child, they're longing to be told

Mm-mm-mm, let me live in that city
The river's so pretty
The air is so fine, mm
Rent me a room
Where I can lay over, oh
I'm just a traveler
Eatin' up travelin' time, oh
I'm just a traveler
Eatin' up my travelin' time''''''''''''''''''''''
