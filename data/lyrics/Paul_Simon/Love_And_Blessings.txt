Simon

Love and blessings
Simple kindness
Fell like rain on thirsty land
Fields and gardens
Long abandoned
Came to life in dust and sand

Lover's lips sweet as honey
Touched as if old love was new
Banker's pockets overflowing with gold and money
Prophesies of wealth come true

Bop-bop-a-whoa
Ain't no song like an old song, Charlie
Bop-bop-a-whoa
There ain't no song like an old song, 
Bop-bop-a-whoa
There ain't no time like a good time Charlie
Bop-bop-a-whoa
Ain't no times like the good times, Charlie
Bop-bop-a-whoa
Whoa

Bop-bop-a-whoa
Bop-bop-a-whoa
Everywhere you look anywhere you go
Everybody working for the
Bop-bop-a-whoa
Bop-bop-a-whoa
Bop-bop-a-whoa
Can't get enough of the
Bop-bop-a-whoa
Bop-bop-a-whoa
Bop-bop-a-whoa

If the summer kept a secret
It was heaven's lack of rain
Golden days and amber sunsets
Let the scientists complain
Came the autumn, drained of color
Ghosts in the water beg for more
Maple trees just a little bit duller
Than the memory of the year before

In a word, or in an image
Something called me from my sleep
Love and blessings
Simple kindness
Ours to hold but not to keep''''''''''''''''''
