The morning came today
With rain and sheets of grey
The subway rocked me out of bed
To take me on my way

Where I go, I go in style
Each and every mile
You know, I'm not alone
New York is my home

I got a girl up in the Proms
She treats me like a king
I'll give her anything she wants
She is my everything

She can be hard as concrete
Soft as a summer breeze
We can wake the dawn
New York is my home

New York is calling me
It's on the phone
It's like the rooftop songs
Up from the cobblestones

You will never hear me say
"The city street's too loud"
I hear a gospel hymn
In every passing crowd

It trails me and it tails me down
To central park
Even after dark
New York is my home

New York is calling me
And now I find
The city never sleeps
It's my state of mind

The breezes blow
And take me where the Hudson never flows
The harbour light shines on the piers
As all young lovers know

I can touch the world
As it sails in from everywhere
I'm not alone
New York is my home

New York is calling me
And now I find
The city never sleeps
It's my state of mind

The breezes blow
And take me where the Hudson never flows
The harbour light shines on the piers
As all young lovers know

I can touch the world
As it sails in from everywhere
I'm not alone
New York is my home

I'm not alone
New York is my home''''''''''''''''''
