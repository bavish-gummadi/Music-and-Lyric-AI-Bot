Who knows my secret broken bone?
Who heals my flesh when the wind blows?
Who is a witness to the dream,
Who kissed my eyes and saw the screams?
Aw-huh - Nobody

Who is my reason to begin?
Who plows the earth, who breaks the skin?
Who took my two hands and made them four,
Who is my heart, who is my door?
Oh yeah, Nobody

Nobody but you girl
Nobody but you
Nobody in this whole wide
World
Nobody

Who makes the bed that can't be made?
Who is my mirror, who is my maid?
When I am rising like a flood,
Who feels the pounding in my blood?
Uh-uh, nobody

Nobody but you girl
Nobody but you
Nobody in this whole wide
World
Nobody, girl
Uh, huh, Nobody

Oh, oh, nobody but you, yes
Well, no one but you
Nobody in this
Whole, wide
World
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody''''''''''''''''''
