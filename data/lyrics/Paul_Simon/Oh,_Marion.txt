The boy's got brains
He just don't use 'em that's all
The boy's got brains
He just refuse to use 'em and that's all
He said "The more I get to thinking,
"The less I tend to laugh."
The boy's got brains
He just abstains

The boy's got a heart
But it beats on the opposite side
It's a strange phenomenon
The laws of nature defied
He said "It's a chance I had to take
"So I shifted my heart for its safety's sake,"
The boy's got a heart but it beats on
His opposite side

Oh, Marion,
I think I'm in trouble here
I should have believed you
When I heard you saying it
The only time
That love is an easy game
Is when two other people 
Are playing it

The boy's got a voice
But the voice is his natural disguise

But his words don't connect to his eyes
He says "Ah, but when I sing
"I can hear the truth auditioning."
The boy's got a voice
But the voice is his natural... 

Oh, Marion,
I think I'm in trouble here
I should have believed you
When I heard you saying it
The only time
That love is an easy game
Is when two other people 
Are playing it''''''''''''''''''
