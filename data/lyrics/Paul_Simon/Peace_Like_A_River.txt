Ah, peace like a river ran through the city
Long past the midnight curfew we sat starry-eyed
Oh, oh, we were satisfied

Oh, and I remember misinformation followed us like a plague
Nobody knew from time to time if the plans were changed
Oh, oh, oh, if the plans were changed

You can beat us with wires
You can beat us with chains
You can run out your rules, but you know
You can't outrun the history train
I seen a glorious day, aiee, ee

Ah, four in the morning, I woke up from out of my dreams
Nowhere to go but back to sleep, but I'm reconciled
Oh, oh, oh, I'm going to be up for a while
Oh, oh, oh, I'm going to be up for a while
Oh, oh, oh, I'm going to be up for a while''''''''''''''''''
