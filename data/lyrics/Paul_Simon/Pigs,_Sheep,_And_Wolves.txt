Big and fat
Pig's supposed to look like that
Barnyard thug
Sleeps on straw and calls it a rug

Yeah that's a rug, okay
He's walking down the street
And nobody's gonna argue with him
He's a half a ton of pig meat

Up in the hills, above the farm
Lives a pack of wolves
Never did no harm
Sleep all day, hunt till four
Maybe catch a couple of rodents
You know a carnivore

Sheep in the meadow, nibbling on some clover
One of the sheep just wanders over
Sits by a rock, separated from the flock
He's just sitting by a rock

Where'd he go? I don't know
Well he was here a minute ago
I don't know, sheep's dead
Got a gash as big as a wolf's head

Oh God, big and fat
Pig's supposed to look like that
Wallowing in lanolin
He's rubbing it into his pigskin

Police are going crazy, sayin'
"Let's get him, let's get that wolf
Let's get him, let's get that wolf
Let's get him, let's kill him, let's get him
Let's kill him"

Court-appointed lawyer wasn't very bright
Maybe he was bright
Maybe he just had a late night
Yeah it was just a late night

And he files some feeble appeal
And the Governor says forget it
It's a done deal
It's election, I don't care, election
Let's give that wolf a lethal injection

Let's get him, let's get that wolf
Let's get him, let's get that wolf
Let's get him, let's kill him, let's get him
Let's kill him, let's get him, kill him
Let's get him, let's kill him, let's ah

Whew, slow, here comes the media
With their camera
Asking everybody's opinion
About pigs, sheep and wolves

Big and fat
Pig's supposed to laugh like that
This is hilarious, what a great time
I'm the pig who committed
The perfect crime

All around the world, France and Scandinavia
There's candle light vigils, protesting this behavior
It's animal behavior, it's animal behavior

It's pigs, sheep and wolves
Pigs, sheep and wolves
Pigs, sheep and wolves
It's animal behavior

It's pigs, sheep and wolves''''''''''''''''
