Begin again
No easy trick
Without a guide or walking stick
Begin before the bells of twilight peal

Downhill town
The road ahead
Spiral, as a serpent's bed
A teaspoon of desire for my meal

I trade my tears
To ask the Lord
For proof of love
If only for the consolation
Of gazing at the stars above

Amen, amen, amen

The road is steep
The air is thin
I hear a voice inside my skin
Don't be afraid
Your days won't end with night
Feel the sun
Drink the rain
Let your body heal its pain
Bathe beneath a waterfall of light

I trade my tears
To ask the Lord
For proof of love
If only for the explanation
That tells me what my dreams are made of

Amen, amen
The valley below
An ocean of debris

I ask the Lord
For proof of love
Love is all I seek

Love is all I seek
And when at times my words desert me
Music is the tongue I speak

I rest my head beside a white oak tree
No deadly nightshade, Belladonna
Dare lay a leaf on me

Silent night
Still as prayer
Darkness fills with light
Love on Earth is everywhere''''''''''''''''''
