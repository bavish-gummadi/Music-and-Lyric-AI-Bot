Ren and Georgette Magritte
With their dog after the war
Returned to their hotel suite
And they unlocked the door
Easily losing their evening clothes
They danced by the light of the moon
To the Penguins, the Moonglows
The Orioles, the Five Satins
The deep forbidden music
They'd been longing for
Ren and Georgette Magritte
With their dog after the war

Ren and Georgette Magritte
With their dog after the war
Were strolling down Christopher Street
When they stopped in a men's store
With all of the mannequins dressed in the style
That brought tears to their immigrant eyes
Just like the Penguins, the Moonglows
The Orioles, the Five Satins
The easy stream of laughter
Flowing through the air
Ren and Georgette Magritte
With their dog aprs la guerre

Side by side, they fell asleep
Decades gliding by like Indians, time is cheap
When they wake up, they will find
All their personal belongings have intertwined
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Ren and Georgette Magritte
With their dog after the war
Were dining with the power elite
And they looked in their bedroom drawer
And what do you think they have hidden away
In the cabinet cold of their hearts?
The Penguins, the Moonglows
The Orioles, and the Five Satins
For now and ever after
As it was before
Ren and Georgette Magritte
With their dog after the war''''''''''''''''
