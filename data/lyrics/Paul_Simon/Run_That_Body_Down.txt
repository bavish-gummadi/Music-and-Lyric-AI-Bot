I went to my doctor yesterday
She said I seem to be OK
She said "Paul, you better look around
How long you think that
You can run that body down?
How many nights you think
That you can do
What you been doing
Who, now who you foolin'?"

I came back home
And I went to bed
I was resting my head
My wife came in
And she said "What's wrong
Sweet boy, what's wrong?"
I told her what's wrong
I said "Peg, you better look around 
How long you think that
You can run that body down?
How many nights you think
That you can do 
What you been doing
Who, now who you foolin'?"

Kids you better look around
How long you think that
You can run that body down?
How many nights you think
That you can do
What you been doing
Who, now who you foolin'?
Who, now who you foolin'?''''''''''''''''''
