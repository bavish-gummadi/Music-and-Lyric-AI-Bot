SAL
I been sleeping on the roof of my building
It's cooler than the street.
I been watching the setting sun
As it bounces off the avenue
Turning into gold dust at my feet.
Oh-woh-oh
Carlos and Yolanda
Dancing in the hallway
To an old melody
Spanish eyes and soft brown curls
My love, my love
Come to me.

I believe I'm in the power of Saint Lazarus.
And he holds me in his sight
I know that these jitterbug days I'm livin',
Well, they won't last for all of us,
But they'll last for a long summer night.
I can feel the fire in her eyes
Tonight, tonight
Under satin summer skies.

The vampires
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh


Girls
Baby, baby, baby
Be my special one
I seen you move in from across the street
I like the way you walk
I love the way you run

Baby, baby,
No more baby talk

Papi, this ain't Mayagez

This is the island of Nueva York

We'll go through the projects,
Make-out on the roofs
An' count the stars like silver studs on
My ...

Motorcycle boots

Tengan cuidado con ese tipo.

Ay verdad te digo, ese tipo es tan sucio.

?Sucio!

Hernandez
You wastin' your time, they don't know what I do
You little ghetto weeds ... I feel like killin' you.

Banana-colored light-skinned spics,
You feel your peel so fine?
I'm Hernndez, The Umbrella Man,
Your future's locked in mine.

The Chaplains and The Golden Guineas
The Red Wings and The Crowns,
The Mighty Mau Maus,
Those Shines from Brooklyn,
They want to cut The Vampires down

The Savage Skulls, The Fordham Baldies,
They'll treat you like you're piss
From the heart of the barrio, now my brother
We tell them mother fuckers suck on this.

I think we got something to talk about.
You're a coolie from the turf.
That's cool, but you don't get no respect around
Here unless you belong to a bopping gang ...
I mean, you either belong or you get hurt.
Or you could buy some protection from me.

'Cause if someone's got to die
To pay for the shit they done
I believe in an eye for an eye
What you believe in, Salvador Agrn?
Mr. Agrn? Senor Agrn?

SAL
I believe I'm in the power of St. Lazarus
And he holds me in his sight
I believe he watches over us all
Don't tear apart
This satin summer night.''''''''''''''''
