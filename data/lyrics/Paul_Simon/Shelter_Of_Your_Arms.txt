[Spoken] OK, once more

Wrap me, wrap me, wrap me, do
In the shelter of your arms.
I'm an extraordinary individual and I will do you no harm
And I will tell you no lies
If you don't want me to
And if you want to I'll lie in the shelter of your arms
In the palm of your embrace

I could deny the obvious, I could rest my case,
And I don't rest my case for no one
If I'm not in the mood to.
When I'm in the mood I try
Take a long look at these laugh lines
They go halfway around the block
In the shelter of your arms, I'll stop the clock
I'll stop the clock
I'll stop the clock

I lived a year once in a hotel
'Cause I failed to read a sign
For a long time I was miserable then I felt just fine
Now I feel so fine so often
I'm like a textbook case
Just a textbook case of fine

(Scat singing)

Wrap me, wrap me, wrap me, do
In the shelter of your arms.
I'm an extraordinary individual and I won't do you no harm
I won't tell you no lies
Unless you want me to
But if you want to I'll lie, lie in the shelter of your arms
In the palm of your embrace
