Silent Eyes
Watching Jerusalem
Make her bed of stones
Silent Eyes
No One will comfort her
Jerusalem
Weeps alone

She is sorrow, sorrow
She burns like a flame
And she calls my name

Silent Eyes
Burning in the desert sun
Halfway to Jerusalem
And we shall all be called as witnesses
Each and ev'ryone
To stand before the eyes of God
And speak what was done''''''''''''''''''
