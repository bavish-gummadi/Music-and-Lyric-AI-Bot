You got the cool water
When the fever runs high
You've got the look of love light
In your eyes
And I was in crazy motion
Till you calmed me down
It took a little time
But you calmed me down

When something goes wrong
I'm the first to admit it
I'm the first to admit it
And the last one to know
When something goes right
Oh, it's likely to lose me, mm
It's apt to confuse me
It's such an unusual sight
Oh, I can't, I can't get used to something so right
Something so right

They got a wall in China
It's a thousand miles long
To keep out the foreigners
They made it strong
And I got a wall around me
That you can't even see
It took a little time
To get next to me

When something goes wrong
I'm the first to admit it
I'm the first to admit it
The last one to know
When something goes right
Oh, it's likely to lose me, mm
It's apt to confuse me
Because it's such an unusual sight
Oh, I swear, I can't get used to something so right
Something so right

Some people never say the words "I love you"
It's not their style to be so bold
Some people never say those words "I love you"
But like a child, they're longing to be told
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

Something goes wrong
I'm the first to admit it
The first to admit it
And the last one to know
When something goes right
Oh, it's likely to lose me, mm
It's apt to confuse me
Because it's such an unusual sight
I swear, I can't, I can't get used to something so right
Something so right

Mm-mm-hmm
Oh, yeah
Something so right'''''''''''''''''
