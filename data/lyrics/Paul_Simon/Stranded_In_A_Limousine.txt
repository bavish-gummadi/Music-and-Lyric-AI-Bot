He was a mean individual
He had a heart like a bone
He was a naturally crazy man
And better off left alone
Well he stopped one night
At a traffic light
And when that light turned green
He was a mean individual
Stranded in a Limousine

Hey hey hey hey
All the children in the street
They come running out their front door
Running out their back doors
Flying on their feet
They said Mama oh Papa oh
See what I have seen
There's a mean individual stranded in a Limousine

Then everybody came running
Everybody said Lord Lord
Everbody was gunning
Theyre gonna divy up the reward
And then wah wah wah wah wah wha wah
With a siren and a flashing light
But the mean individual
He vanished in the black of night

Hey hey hey hey
They wondered where to begin
'Cause he left that neighborhood
Just like the rattlesnake sheds its skin
Well then they searched the roofs
And they checked out the groups
And they photographed the scene
For the mean individual
Stranded in a Limousine

Then everybody came running
Everybody said Lord Lord
Everbody was gunning
Theyre gonna divy up the reward
And then wah wah wah wah wah wha wah
With a siren and a flashing light
But the mean individual
He vanished in the black of night

The mean individual
He vanished in the black of night

The mean individual
He vanished in the black of night''''''''''''''''''
