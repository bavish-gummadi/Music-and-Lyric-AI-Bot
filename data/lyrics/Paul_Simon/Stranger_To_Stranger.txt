Stranger to stranger
If we met for the first time
This time
Could you imagine us
Falling in love again
Words and melody
So the old story goes
Fall from summer trees
When the wind blows

I can't wait to see you walk across my doorway
I cannot be held accountable
For the things I do or say

I'm just jittery
I'm just jittery
It's just a way of dealing with my joy
It's just a way of dealing with my joy
It's just a way of dealing with my joy
It's just a way of dealing

Words and melodies
Easy harmony
Old-time remedies

All in good time
Although most of the time
It's just hard working
The same piece of clay
Day after day
Year after year
Certain melodies tear your heart apart
Reconstruction is a lonesome art

But I love to watch you walk across my doorway
I cannot be held accountable
For the things I do or say

I'm just jittery
I'm just jittery
It's just a way of dealing with my joy
It's just a way of dealing with my joy
Just a way of dealing with my joy

Words and melody

Stranger to stranger
If we met for the first time
This time
Could you imagine us
Falling in love again

Still believing
That love endures
All the carnage
And the useless detours

Oh I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, love you, love you
I love you, love you, love you

Words and melody
Easy harmony
