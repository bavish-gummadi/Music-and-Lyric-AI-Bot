I registered to vote today. Felt like a fool. Had to do it anyway. Down at the high
School. Thing about the second line. You know, felt like a fool? People say it all the
Time. Even when it's true. So, who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my
Shoe? Who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe? Cause it sure don't
Feel like love.
A tear drop consists of electrolytes and salt. The chemistry of crying is not
Concerned with blame or fault. So, who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my
Shoe? Who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe? Cause it sure don't feel
Like love. How does it feel? Feels like a threat. A voice in your head that you'd rather
Forget. No joke, no joke. You get sick from that unspoken. Sure don't feel like love.
No joke, no joke. Some chicken and a corn muffin well that feels more like love.
Yay! Boo!
Yay! Boo!
Wrong again. Wrong again. Maybe I'm wrong again. Wrong again. Maybe I'm
Wrong again. Wrong again. I could be wrong again. I remember once in August
1993, I was wrong, and I could be wrong again. I remember one of my best friends
Turned enemy. So, I was wrong, and I could be wrong again. I remember once in a
Load-out, down in Birmingham. Yeah, but that didn't feel like love. Sure don't feel
Like, sure don't feel like, sure don't feel like love. Sure don't feel like, sure don't
Feel like, sure don't feel like love. It sure. Don't feel.
Like love.'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
