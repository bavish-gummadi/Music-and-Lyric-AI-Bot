Well I'll just skip the boring parts, chapters one, two, three 
And get to the place where you can read my face and my biography.

Here I am, I'm eleven months old, dangling from my daddy's knee. 
There I go, it's my graduation, I'm picking up a bogus degree. 

That's me. Early me. That's me. That's me. 

Well I never cared much for the money, and money never cared for me. 
I was more like a land-locked sailor, searching for the emerald sea.
Just searching for the emerald sea, boys, searching for the sea.

Oh my God. First love opens like a flower. 
A black bear running through the forest light holds me in her sight and her power. 
But tricky skies, your eyes are true, the future is beauty and sorrow. 
Still, I wish that we could run away and live the life we used to. 
If just for tonight and tomorrow.

I am walking up the face of the mountain, counting every step I climb.
Remembering the names of the constellations. forgotten is a long, long time.
That's me, I'm in the valley of twilight. 
Now I'm on the continental shelf. 
That's me I'm answering a question I am asking of myself.'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
