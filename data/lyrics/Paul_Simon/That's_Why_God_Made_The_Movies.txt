When I was born my mother died
She said bye-bye baby, bye-bye
I said "Where you goin'?"
"I'm just born"
She said I'll only be gone for a while
My mother loved to leave in style
And that's why God made the movies

So I laid around in my swaddling clothes
Until the doctor came and turned out the light
Then I packed my bag
And my nametag
And stole away into the night
Hopeing things would work out alright
That's why God made the movies

Say you will, say you will
Say you'll take me to your loving breast
Say you'll nourish me with your tenderness
The way the ladies sometimes do
Say you won't, say you won't
Say you won't leave me for no other man
Say you'll love me for the way I am
Say you will, say you will

When I was born my mother died
She said bye-bye baby, bye-bye
And since that day
I've made my way
The notorious boy of the wild
Adopted by wolves when he was a child
That's why God. That's why God.
That's why God made the movies'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
