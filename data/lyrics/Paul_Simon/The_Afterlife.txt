After I died, and the makeup had dried, I went back to my place
No moon that night, but a heavenly light shone on my face
Still I thought it was odd, there was no sign of God just to usher me in
Then a voice from above, sugar coated with Love, said, "Let us begin."

You got to fill out a form first, and then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first, and then you wait in the line

OK, a new kid in school, got to follow the rule, you got to learn the routine
Whoa, there's a girl over there, with the sunshiny hair, like a homecoming queen
I said, "Hey, what you say? It's a glorious day, by the way how long you been dead?"
Maybe you, maybe me, maybe baby makes three, but she just shook her head...

You got to fill out a form first, and then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first, and then you wait in the line

Buddha and Moses and all the noses from narrow to flat
Had to stand in the line, just to glimpse the divine, what you think about that?
Well, it seems like our fate to suffer and wait for the knowledge we seek
It's all his design, no one cuts in the line, no one here likes a sneak

You got to fill out a form first, and then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first, and then you wait in the line

After you climb, up the ladder of time, the Lord God is here
Face to face, in the vastness of space, your words disappear
And you feel like swimming in an ocean of love, and the current is strong
But all that remains when you try to explain is a fragment of song...
Lord is it, be bop a lu la or ooh poppa do
Lord, be bop a lu la or ooh poppa do
Be bop a lu la''''''''''''''''''
