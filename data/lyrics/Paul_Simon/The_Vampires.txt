Hernandez
Well, did you bring me my money,
My cab fare
My new shoes?
I got expenses, you know
Where's my weekly dues?

SAL
I ain't giving you my fucking money.

Hernandez
Oye, mother fucker, where's this jibaro from?
You go when I say.
I call, you come.
You know it takes a strong man to survive.
It ain't no accident that you're still alive.

Hernandez and the vampires
We stand for the neighborhood.

Hernandez
He still lives with his mami, but he sneaks down,
A coolie in the shadow of the playground
You want to fight for your people, don't you, Sal?

SAL
Well, yeah, if I got to.

Hernandez
Oh you got to. Come here, I want to show you something.
This is the cave of the Vampires,
Count Dracula's castle,
The very sight could turn a white man grey.
Made in the shade, use my umbrella
Black like the night we fly in.
That blade is all you need to keep the dogs away.
So you want to be a vampire, man! That's good.
We always looking for young blood in the neighborhood now.
Carlos Apache collects the dues,
So you bring us something that we can use.

Hernandez and the vampires
If you got the balls, then come on, mette mano,
If you got the balls, then come on, mette mano.

Hernandez
Frenchy Cordego goes down to Hell's Kitchen
To sell the Irish some weed.
So this Paddy boys mother on the stoop starts bitchin'
'Bout spics is a mongrel breed.
Now here comes her son
He looks like a ton of corned beef
Floating in beer.
He says "Fucking Puerto Rican dope-dealing punk,
Get your shit brown ass out of here."

Hernandez and the vampires
"Fucking Puerto Rican dope-dealing punk,
Get your shit brown ass out of here."
We stand for the neighborhood.

Hernandez
So the shanty-town Irish they kicked his ass good.
Fractured his collar bone
Co'o, all I was thinking is "What home of the brave?
This a fucking war zone."

Hernandez and the vampires
If you got the balls, then come on, mette mano.
We stand for the neighborhood.
If you got cojones, come on, mette mano.
We stand for the neighborhood.
If you got the balls, then come on, mette mano.
We stand for the neighborhood.
If you got the cojones, come on, mette mano.''''''''''''''''''
