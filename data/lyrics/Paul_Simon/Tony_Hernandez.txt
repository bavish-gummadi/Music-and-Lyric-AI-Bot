You know it takes a strong man to survive
Tony, Tony is that you? Man, I thought you were dead
No man, just living in the Bronx
Well, same thing, that's what I said

I know your parole board don't want us to meet each other
That's why I'm not in the light
But I see you now, my death row brother
And it looks like you made it all right

I'm going to see Carlos and Yolanda
Come on and walk by my side
I don't like to see nobody, only you
Well, it ain't like we gotta hide

So, how've you been doing?
Doin' the best I can
I got a job at Beekman downtown hospital
Working as a cleaning man

But there's one stain that don't fade
You know what I'm talking about, Sal
Yeah
It's the first time you seen the parade?
Yes, it's nice, yeah

I'll be glad to see my mother
My father passed away, oh, I'm sorry
But I got a little daughter
It balances so, I guess it's okay

Give your moms my love
When I look up at the sky above
It's like an old umbrella with holes
I'm glad I seen you, write a big best seller
And may God accept our souls''''''''''''''''
