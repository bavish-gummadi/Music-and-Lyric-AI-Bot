Train in the distance

She was beautiful as southern skies the night he met her
She was married to someone
He was doggedly determined that he would get her
He was old, he was young
From time to time, he'd tip his heart
But each time she withdrew
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true

Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Train in the distance

Well, eventually, the boy and the girl get married
Sure enough, they have a son
And though they both were occupied with the child she carried
Disagreements had begun
And in a while, they just fell apart
It wasn't hard to do
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true

Two disappointed believers
Two people playing the game
Negotiations and love songs
Are often mistaken for one and the same

Well, now the man and the woman, they remain in contact
Let us say it's for the child
With disagreements about the meaning of a marriage contract
Conversations hard and wild
But from time to time, he just makes her laugh
She cooks a meal or two
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true

What is the point of this story?
What information pertains?
The thought that life could be better
Is woven indelibly into our hearts and our brains
Like a train in the distance

Train in the, train in the
