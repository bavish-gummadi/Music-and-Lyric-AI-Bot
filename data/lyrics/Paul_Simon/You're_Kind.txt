You're kind
You're so kind
You rescued me when I was blind
And you put me on your pillow
When I was on the wall
You're so kind
So kind
So kind

And you're good
You're so good
You introduced me to you
Neighborhood
Seems like I ain't never had
So many friends before
That's because you're good
You're so good

Why you don't treat me like
The other humans do
Is just a mystery to me
It gets me agitated when I think that
You're gonna love me now indefinitely

So goodbye, goodbye
I'm gonna leave you now
And here's the reason why
I like to sleep with the window open
And you keep the window closed

So goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
