A man walks down the street
He says, Why am I soft in the middle now?
Why am I soft in the middle?
When the rest of my life is so hard!
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard

Bone-digger, bone-digger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away, my well-lit door
Mr. Beer Belly, Beer Belly
Get these mutts away from me!
You know, I don't find this stuff amusing anymore

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al

A man walks down the street
He says, Why am I short of attention?
Got a short little span of attention
And whoa, my nights are so long!
Where's my wife and family?
What if I die here?
Who'll be my role-model?
Now that my role-model is
Gone, gone
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly, little bat-faced girl
All along, along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al

A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the Third World
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound, sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning into infinity
He says, Amen! and Hallelujah!

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me

Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, n-n-n-n-na
Na, na, na, na
N-n-n-n-na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na

If you'll be my bodyguard (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I can call you Betty (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
If you'll be my bodyguard (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I can call you Betty (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
If you'll be my bodyguard''''''''''''''''''
