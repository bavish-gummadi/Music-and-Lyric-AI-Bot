You don't like crazy music.
You don't like rockin' bands.
You just wanna go to a movie show,
And sit there holdin' hands.
You're so square.
Baby, I don't care.

I don't care why my heart flips.
I only know it does.
I only wonder why I love you, baby.
I guess it's just because
You're so square.
Baby, I don't care.

You don't know any dances that are new,
But no one else could love me like you do, do, do, do.

You don't like crazy music.
You don't like rockin' bands.
You just wanna go to a movie show,
And sit there holdin' hands.
You're so square.
Baby, I don't care.

Baby, I don't care.

Baby, I don't care.''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
