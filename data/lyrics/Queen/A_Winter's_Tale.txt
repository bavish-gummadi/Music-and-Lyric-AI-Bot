It's Winter-fall
Red skies are gleaming, oh
Sea-gulls are flyin' over
Swans are floatin' by
Smoking chimney-tops
Am I dreaming
Am I dreaming?

The nights draw in
There's a silky moon up in the sky, yeah
Children are fantasizing
Grown-ups are standin' by
What a super feeling
Am I dreaming
Am I dreaming?
Woh woh woh woh

(Dreaming) So quiet and peaceful
(Dreaming) Tranquil and blissful
(Dreaming) There's a kind of magic in the air
(Dreaming) What a truly magnificent view
(Dreaming) A breathtaking scene
With the dreams of the world in the palm of your hand

(Dreaming) A cosy fireside chat
(Dreaming) A little this, a little that
(Dreaming) Sound of merry laughter skippin' by
(Dreaming) Gentle rain beatin' on my face
(Dreaming) What a extraordinary place

And the dream of the child is the hope of the hope of the man

It's all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting in the sky, yeah
Mountains are zooming higher, mmm
Little doves scream and cry
My world is spinning and spinning and spinning
It's unbelievable
Sends me reeling
Am I dreaming
Am I dreaming
Ooh it's bliss''''''''''''''''''''''''
