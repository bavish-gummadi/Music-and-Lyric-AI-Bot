The minute you walked in the joint,
I could see you were a man of
Distinction,
A real big spender,
Good looking, so refined,
So wouldn't you like to know
What's going on in my mind,

So let me get right to the point,
I don't pop my cork for every man
I see,
Hey Big Spender,
Spend a little time with me

Wouldn't you like to have fun,
Fun, fun,
How about a few laughs, laughs, laughs,
I could show you a fun, laughs, good times,
Fun, laughs, good times,
Fun, laughs, good times,

Hey big spender,
Spend a little time with me

The minute you walked in the joint,
I could see you were a man of
Distinction,
A real big spender,

Wouldn't you like to know,

Hey Big Spender,
Hey Big Spender,
Hey Big Spender,
Spend a little time with me.''''''''''''''''''''
