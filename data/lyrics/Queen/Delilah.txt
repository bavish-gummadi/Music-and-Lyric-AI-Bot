Delilah Delilah
Oh my oh my oh my you're irresistible
You make me smile when I'm just about to cry
You bring me hope you make me laugh - and I like it
You get away with murder so innocent
But when you throw a moody you're all claws and you bite
That's all right

Delilah Delilah
Oh my oh my oh my you're unpredictable
You make me so very happy
When you cuddle up and go to sleep beside me
And then you make me slightly mad
When you pee all over my Chippendale suite

Delilah Delilah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

You take over my house and home
You even try to answer my telephone
Delilah you're the apple of my eye

Meeow meeow meeow
Delilah I love you Delilah
Oh you make me so very happy
You give me kisses and I go out of my mind ooh
Meeow meeow meeow
You're irresistible - I love you Delilah
Delilah I love you

Hah hah
You make me very happy
Oh yeah - I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your kisses
I love your your your kisses
I love your kisses''''''''''''''''''
