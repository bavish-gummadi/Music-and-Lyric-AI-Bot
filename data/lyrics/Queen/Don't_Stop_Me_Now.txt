Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive

And the world I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now
Don't stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time
Having a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger
Defying the laws of gravity

I'm a racing car passing by
Like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stopping me

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball

Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call

Don't stop me now
Cause I'm havin' a good time
Don't stop me now
Yes I'm havin' a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite
I'm out of control

I'm a sax machine ready to reload like an atom bomb
About to whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

(Don't stop me)
(Don't stop me)
(Don't stop me)
Hey, hey, hey

(Don't stop me)
(Don't stop me)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I like it!

(Don't stop me)
(Don't stop me) (Hey-hi!)
Have a good time
Good time

(Don't stop me)
(Don't stop me)
Ahh
Let loose, honey!
All right

Oh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah
200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit, hey!
Travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
Yeah, yeah

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball

Don't stop me now
(Woo!) If you wanna have a good time
(All right!) Just give me a call

Don't stop me now
'Cause I'm havin' a good time

Don't stop me now
Yes, I'm havin' a good time
I don't want to stop at all
