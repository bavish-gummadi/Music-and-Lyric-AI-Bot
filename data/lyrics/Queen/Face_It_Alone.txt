When something here so near
And dear to life
Explodes inside
You feel your soul
Is set on fire

There's something

When the moon has lost it's clothes
And the sun begins to Loom

When something here so near (and so far)
And dear to life (tonight)
Explodes inside (falls down inside)

You feel your soul (you cry till you hurt)
Is set on fire (go out and hear)

There's something

When the moon has lost it's clothes

And the sun begins to Loom''''''''''''''''
