A word in your ear
From father to son
Hear the word that I say
I fought with you
Fought on your side
Long before you were born

Joyful the sound
The word goes around
From father to son to son

And the voice is so clear
Time after time it keeps
Calling you, calling you on
Don't destroy what you see
Your country to be
Just keep building on the ground that's been won

Kings will be crowned
The word goes around
From father to son to son

Won't you hear us sing
Our family song?
Now we hand it on
But I've heard it all before

Take this letter that I give you
Take it sonny, hold it high
You won't understand a word that's in it
But you'll write it all again before you die

A word in your ear
From father to son
Funny you don't hear a single word that I say
But my letter to you
Will stay by your side through the years
Till the loneliness is gone

Sing if you will
But the air you breathe
I live to give you
Father to son father to son
Father to son father to son

Joyful the sound
Word goes around
Father to son to son
Kings will be crowned
Earth goes around
Father to son to son

Joyful the sound
Word goes around
Father to son to son
Kings will be crowned
Earth goes around
Father to son to son''''''''''''''''''
