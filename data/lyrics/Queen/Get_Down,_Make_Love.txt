Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
You take my body
I give you heat
You say you hungry
I give you meat
I suck your mind
You blow my head
Make love - (make love)
Inside your bed - everybody get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

Everytime I get hot
You wanna cool down
Everytime I get high
You say you wanna come down
You say it's enough
In fact it's too much
Everytime I get a - get down, get down
Get down, make love

Oh, sss, hah

I can squeeze - you can shake me (get down, make love)
I can feel - when you break me (get down, make love)
Come on so heavy - when you take me (get down, make love)
You make love, you make love, you make love, you make love
(Get down, make love)
You can make everybody get down, make love
Get down, make love

Everytime I get high
You wanna come down
Everytime I get hot
You say you wanna cool down
You say it's enough
In fact it's too much
Everytime I wanna, get down
Get down, get down

Ah, ooh, make love, make love, make love, make love, make love
Ah, oh

Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

You say it's enough
In fact it's just too much
Everytime I wanna, get down
Get down, get down, make love''''''''''''''''''
