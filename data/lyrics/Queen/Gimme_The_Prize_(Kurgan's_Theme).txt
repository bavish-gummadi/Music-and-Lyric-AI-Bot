..Garage and water from the sprinklers. It also left a man's decapitated body lying on the floor next to his own severed head... a head which at this time has no name.

I know his name.

Here I am!
I'm the master of your destiny (Ha-ha!)
I am the one, the only one
I am the god of Kingdom Come
Gimme the prize!
Just gimme the prize!
Give me your kings,
Let me squeeze them in my hands
Your puny princes,
Your so-called leaders of your land

I'll eat them whole before I'm done
The battle's fought and the game is won
I am the one, the only one
I am the god of Kingdom Come
Gimme the prize!
Just gimme the prize! (The prize.)

Now you die

I have something to say... it's better to burn out than to fade away!

There can be only one!

Move over!
I said move over!
Hey, hey, hey! Clear the way
There's no escape from my authority (Didn't I tell you?)
I am the one, the only one
I am the god of Kingdom Come
Gimme the prize just gimme the prize
I am the one, the only one
I am the god of Kingdom Come
Just gimme the prize

There can be only one.'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
