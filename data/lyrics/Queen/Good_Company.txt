Take good care of what you've got
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and Baby B.
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all good company

Ooh hoo, oh hoo
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company

Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day with Sally J.
The girl from number four
And very soon I begged her won't you
Keep me company
Ooh hoo, oh hoo
Come marry me for evermore we'll be good company

Now marriage is an institution, sure
My wife and I, our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year
By and by disappear
But we're safe enough behind our door

I flourished in my humble trade, my reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours, but when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts my own limited company

I hardly noticed Sally as we parted company
All through the years in the end it appears
There was never really anyone but me
Now I'm old I puff my pipe
But no one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of my life's insanity
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company''''''''''''''''
