I can dim the lights
And sing you songs full of sad things
We can do the tango just for two
I can serenade and gently play
On your heart strings
Be your Valentino just for you

Ooh, love
Ooh, lover boy
What ya doin' tonight? Hey boy
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy

Ooh, let me feel your heartbeat
(Grow faster, faster)
(Ooh) Can you feel my love heat?
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love
And tell me, how do you feel right after all?
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish is my command

Ooh, love
Ooh, lover boy
What ya doin' tonight? Hey boy
Write me a letter, feel much better
And use my fancy patter on the telephone

When I'm not with you
Think of you always, I miss you
(I miss those long hot summer nights)
When I'm not with you
Think of me always, I love you, love you
(Hey boy where did you get it from?
Hey boy where did you go?)
I learned my passion
In the good old-fashioned school of lover boys

Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine precisely
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine o'clock)
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours that will be fine
Come on and get it
Ooh, love
There it goes again
Ooh, lover boy
There he goes again just like a good old-fashioned lover boy
(What you did tonight? Hey boy)
Ev'rything's all right just hold on tight
That's because I'm a good old (fashioned) fashioned lover boy''''''''''''''''''
