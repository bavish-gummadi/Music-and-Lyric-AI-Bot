Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight

You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall

Oh ev'ry night and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face the Western Way
Build your muscles as your body decays

Toe your line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall

Rich or poor or famous
For your truth it's all the same (oh no, oh no)
Lock your door the rain is pouring
Through your window pane (oh no)
Baby now your struggle's all in vain, hey, hey

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder

What the hell we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
Just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the hammer to hammer to fall

It's gonna fall
Hammer
You know
Hammer to fall
While you're waiting for the hammer to fall
Give it to me one more time''''''''''''''''
