And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
And there's nothin' you can do about it
Nothin' you can do
No there's nothin' you can do about it
No there's nothin' you can nothin' you can nothin' you can do about it

And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
You can do about it
Yeah

Hey he used to be a man with a stick in his hand
Hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do
She used to be a woman with a hot dog stand
Hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're gettin' in a fight
Then it ain't so groovy when you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap 'B' movie

Headlong down the highway and you're rushing
Headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'
And there's nothin' you can nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it

When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do
Soon the fire starts raging gets you more than half crazy
Hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do
Now they start freaking everywhere you turn
You can't start walking cause your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
Cause reason's out of the window
Better hold on tight

You're rushing headlong
Headlong out of control - yeah
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
And there's nothin' you nothin' you nothin' you can do about it at all

Yeah yeah
All right - go

And you're rushing headlong down the highway
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
There's nothin' - nothin' - nothin' you can do about it

Ah ha
Headlong
Yeah yeah yeah
Headlong
