I said "Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou
I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou
We'd never part
So Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart"

You passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
And ooh I wanted you forever more
Now I'm not one that gets around
I swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did see you before

I said "Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou
I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou
We'd never part
So Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart"
So Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart"
So Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart"''''''''''''''''''''
