Adventure seeker
On an empty street
Just an alley creeper
Light on his feet
A young fighter screaming
With no time for doubt
With the pain and anger
Can't see a way out
It ain't much I'm asking
I heard him say
Gotta find me a future
Move out of my way

I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
And I want it now!
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
And I want it now!

Listen all you people
Come gather 'round
I gotta get me a game plan
Gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me
What I know is mine
People do you hear me?
Just give me the sign

It ain't much I'm asking
If you want the truth
Here's to the future
For the dreams of youth...

I want it all (give it all)
I want it all
I want it all
And I want it now!
I want it all (yes I want it all)
I want it all (hey)
I want it all
And I want it...

Now...
I'm a man with a one track mind
So much to do in one life time
Not a man for compromise
And where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all (yes I'm living it all)
And I'm giving it all (and I'm giving it all)

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I want it all all all all

It ain't much I'm asking
If you want the truth
Here's to the future
Hear the cry... hear the cry... hear the cry of youth

I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
And I want it now!

I want it all (yeah yeah yeah)
I want it all
I want it all
And I want it now

I want it...
Now!

I want it... I want it...''''''''''''''''''
