You can't stop it, you can't stop it, you can't stop it, the world is in my pocket
You can't stop it, you can't stop it, you can't stop it, I want to profit
You got what I want and I need it right now, give it to me baby I don't care how

I hold my money with my left, got the world in my right pocket
Smoke a stoke in my right in between counting my profits
Poker face as I soak up the taste of display of women on my sofa
Doing the type of things I love so much
But so what, I'm sleazy it's not easy being Joe Smut
With more bucks than you can count, more than what's in your clutch
I could fund a small war and start a recession, the big dog, the boss hog
What I want is the question:

I want it all, I want it all, I need it all right now, I want it all
I gotta get it, I got gots to get it, yo-
I want it all, I want it all, I need it all right now
I want it all, I want it all and I want it now

You got what I want and I need it right now, give it to me baby
I don't care how
I want it all, I want it all

If I don't get what I want then I'll take it in blood the queasy thug
Whose greed and lust just like cheap drugs that keep me buzzed
The heat and fuzz couldn't touch me I'm out of reach because
I'm eating lunch with a shady bunch, about to meet the judge
When people see me, they point and whisper "he's corrupt"
He couldn't care less, he's fearless, he'll give the reaper hugs
And as a kid he never took crap from no one
Mud on his face, such a disgrace, cussin at grown-ups

Buddy you're a boy make a big noise
Playin' in the street gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on yo' face
You big disgrace
Kickin' your can all over the place

I want it all, I want it all, I need it all right now
I want it all, I gotta get it, I got gots to get it, yo-
I want it all, I want it all I need it all right now
I want it all, I want it all and I want it now

(Don't you know who I am?) I'm a big boss with big balls, everybody knows me
I'm a big deal, you should kneel, and crawl when you approach me
I got big bucks, big cars, I'm bigger than all the universe and its stars
I could buy your life whatever it costs
Name your price, give me what I need then get lost
I could buy the blue from the sky I'm a rich hog
Give me it now, I'm not the guy you want to piss off
By any means, I get what I want and I want it all

(Rock with me, guitar please. I'm egotistical. I'm a narcissist. I'm a big deal
Power and profit, yeah, power and profit.)

You got what I want and I need it right now, give it to me baby I don't care how
I got the world in my pocket and it's still not enough for me
I want it all and I want it right now
I want it all and I want it right now
I want it all and I want it right now
I want it all and I want it right now
I want it all and I want it right now
And I want it right now

I want it all, I need it and I don't care how
I gotta get it, I got gots to get it now
I could feel it coming, it's any moment now
I want it all and I want it now
It's so intense I'm breaking, you can't hold me down
I gotta get it, I got gots to get it now
I could feel it coming, it's any moment now
I want it all and I want it now

You can't stop it (I want it all) you can't stop it
I want to profit, the world is in my pocket (right now)
You can't stop it (I want it all) you can't stop it
You can't stop it, I want to profit

You can't stop it (I want it all) you can' stop it
I want to profit, the world is in my pocket (right now)
You can't stop it (I want it all) you can't stop it
You can't stop it (I want it all and I want it now), I want to profit''''''''''''''''''
