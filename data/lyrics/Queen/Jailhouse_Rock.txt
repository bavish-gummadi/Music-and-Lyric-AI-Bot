The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the purple gang

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock

Number forty seven said to number three
You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the jailhouse rock with me

Lets rock, everybody, lets rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock

The sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone
Way over in the corner, weepin' all alone
The warden said, hey, buddy, don't you be no square
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock

Shifty Henry said to bugs, for heavens sake
No one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break
Bugsy turned to shifty and he said, nix, nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock''''''''''''''''''
