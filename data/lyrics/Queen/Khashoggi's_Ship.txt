Who said my party was all over, huh, huh,
I'm in pretty good shape,
The best years of my life are like a supernova,
Huh, huh, perpetual craze, I said that
Everybody drank my wine - you get my drift,
And then we took a holiday on khashoggi's Ship - well,
We really had a good good time they was all so sexy
We was bad, we was blitzed,
All in all it was a pretty good trip,

This big bad sucker with a fist as big as your head,
Wanted to get me, I said go away
I said kiss my ass honey,
He pulled out a gun, wanted to arrest me,
I said uh, uh, babe,
Now listen no one stops my party,
No one stops my party,
No one, no one, no one stops my party,
Just like I said,
We were phased, we was pissed,
Just having a total eclipse,

Bup bup, badabup, badibup bup bup bedabup bedadee hey
That's good
Ooh
Wooh wooh wooh wooh wooh wooh (--background screaching)
