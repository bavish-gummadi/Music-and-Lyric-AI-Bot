Don't touch me now
Don't hold me now
Don't break the spell darling
Now you are near
Look in my eyes and speak to me
The special promises I long to hear

Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Love me slow and gently

One foolish world so many souls
Senselessly hurled through
The never ending cold
And all for fear and all for greed
Speak any tongue
But for God's sake we need

Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Let me know this night and evermore

This room is bare
This night is cold
We're far apart and I'm growing old
But while we live
We'll meet again
So then my love
We may whisper once more
It's you I adore

Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Touch me now
Las palabras de amor
Let us share the words of love
For evermore evermore
For evermore''''''''''''''''''
