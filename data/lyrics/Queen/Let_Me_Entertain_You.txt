Hey - it's a sellout

Hey - let me welcome you ladies and gentlemen
I would like to say hello
Are you ready for some entertainment?
Are you ready for a show?
Gonna rock, gonna roll you
Get you dancing in the aisles
Jazz you, razzmatazz you
With a little bit of style
Come on, let me entertain you!
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

I've come here to sell you my body
I can show you some good merchandise
I'll pull you and I'll pill you
I'll Cruella-de-Ville you
And to thrill you I'll use any device

We'll give you crazy performance
We'll give you grounds for divorce
We'll give you piece de resistance
And a tour de force, of course!

We found the right location
Got a lot of pretty lights
The sound and amplification, listen!
Hey if you need a fix, if you want a high
Stickell's see to that
With Electra and E.M.I.
We'll show you where it's at
So come on, let me entertain you!
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

Just take a look at the menu
We give you rock a la carte
We'll breakfast at Tiffany's
We'll sing to you in Japanese
We're only here to entertain you

If you want to see some action
You get nothing but the best
The S and M attraction
We've got the pleasure chest
Chicago down to New Orleans
We get you on the line
If you dig the New York scene
We'll have a son of a bitch of a time
Come on!
Let me entertain-
Let me entertain-
Let me entertain you tonight!

Hey where's my backstage pass?
That was great
What an outrageous costume
Hey that Brian May is outta sight man
Not many, not many
I've always wanted to be a groupie''''''''''''''''''
