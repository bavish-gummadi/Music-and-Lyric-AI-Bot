When people talk of love I'll leave the conversation
I'll say I feel just fine, happy with my situation
But when I look away people know my mind is straying
To where I once belonged, dreaming about your heart again
Your heart again, your heart again
Let me in your heart again
Listen to me honey

We like to face the blues, I give you satisfaction
Despair was on your mind I give you the right direction
So don't you walk away remember is my heart you're breaking
You forget we were a love, now my heart is only filled with the pain

Your heart again, your heart again
Let me in your heart again

Oh my love I want you to stay
Don't leave me now or I'll just fade away
Oh my love don't hurt me this way

Oh looking baby

Don't make me wait too long or I'll lose my mind

When people talk of love I have no hesitation
Tell me what you dream at all I'll hold that conversation for you babe
But when I look away people know my mind is straying, babe
To where I once belonged
Just let me in your heart again, your heart again, let me in your heart again

Open the doors for me babe
It's your heart again
Let me in
Let me in your heart again''''''''''''''''''''
