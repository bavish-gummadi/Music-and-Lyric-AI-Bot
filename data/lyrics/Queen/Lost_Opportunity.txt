Words and music by Queen

With the morning I face the sun
I lift my head and smile for everyone
Every afternoon you'll find me working on
I got my new shoes on
Got to be moving on
That's what they say
Every night I'm tossed
And I shake my fevered brow
Thinking of my lost opportunity

Yes every morning I face the sun
I get so positive with everyone
Every afternoon you'll find the cracks showing through
They know what I'm going through
Oh yes they do
Every evening finds me
The optimist behind me
On with my lost opportunity''''''''''''''''
