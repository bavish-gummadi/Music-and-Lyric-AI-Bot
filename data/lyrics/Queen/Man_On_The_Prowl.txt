Words and music by Freddie Mercury

I'm gonna take a little walk on the wild side
I'm gonna loosen up and get me some gas
I'm gonna get me some action
Go crazy driving is the fast lane
My baby left me alone
She done me dirty and I'm feeling so lonely
So come home come home
If you don't you're gonna break my heart

Man on the prowl
You'd better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
So look out (yeah yeah) - look out (yeah yeah)
I'm a man on the prowl

I don't wanna be a rock'n'roll steady
I just wanna be low down trash
I wanna go to the movies
All I wanna do is sit on my ass
So honey come home (come home come home)
Don't leave me when I'm feeling so lonely
Come home (yeah yeah) - come home (yeah yeah)
If you don't you're gonna break my heart

Man on the prowl
You'd better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
So look out (yeah yeah) - look out (yeah yeah)
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl

Well I keep dreaming about my baby
But it ain't gonna get me nowhere
I'm gonna teach my baby dancin'
But I ain't no Fred Astaire

So baby look out - I'm a man on the prowl
Look out - man on the prowl - yeah!
Baby baby baby look out - man on the prowl

So baby come home
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
Baby come home - oh yeah!
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl
So honey come home - come home
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl - yeah!
Man on the prowl''''''''''''''''''
