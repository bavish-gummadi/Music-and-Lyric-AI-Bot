Do you mean it, do you mean it, do you mean it?
Why don't you mean it? 
Why do I follow you, and where do you go?

Ah ah ah...

You've never seen nothing like it
No never in your life
Like going up to heaven
And then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it
If the world will so allow it
Ooh give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night

Here comes the Black Queen poking in the pile
Fi fo the Black Queen marching single file
Take this take that bring them down to size
March to the Black Queen

Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
Little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a-baby oil
Black on black on every finger nail and toe
We've only begun begun
Make this make that keep making all that noise
Ooh march to the Black Queen

Now I've got a belly full
You can be my sugar baby
You can be my honey chile

A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy

Everything you do bears a will
And a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy

In each and every soul lies a man
And very soon he'll deceive and discover
But even to the end of his life
He'll bring a little love

Ah ah ah...

I reign with my left hand I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness I'm queen of the night
I've got the power
Now do the march of the Black Queen

My life is in your hands I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the Black Queen

Ah ah ah...

Walking true to style she's vulgar abuse and vile
Fi fo The Black Queen tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes
And she never dots her I's

La la la...

So forget your sing a-longs and your lullabies
Surrender to the singing of the fireflies
Dance to the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand in hand
But now it's time to be gone
La la la la forever forever
La la la...''''''''''''''''''
