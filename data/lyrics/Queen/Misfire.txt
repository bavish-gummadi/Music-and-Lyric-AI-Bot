Don't you misfire fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Don't you know honey that love's a game
It's always a hit or miss
So take your aim
Got to hold on tight
Shoot me out of sight
Don't you misfire fill me up
With the desire to carry on

Don't you misfire fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Your gun is loaded
And pointing my way
There's only one bullet
So don't delay
Got to time it right
Fire me through the night
Come on take a shot
Fire me higher
Don't you miss this time
Please don't misfire
Misfire''''''''''''''''''
