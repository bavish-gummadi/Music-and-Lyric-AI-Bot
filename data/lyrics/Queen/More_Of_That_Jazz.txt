If you're feelin' tired and lonely
Uninspired and lonely
If you're thinkin' how the days seem long
All you're given
Is what you've been given
A thousand times before
Just more more
More of that jazz
More no more of that jazz
Give me no more
No more of that jazz

Only football gives us thrills
Rock'n'roll just pays the bills
Only our team is the real team
Bring out the dogs get on your feet
Lay on the floor
Can't help thinkin' I've heard that line before
Just more more
More of that jazz
More no more of that jazz
Give me no more
No more of that jazz

Oh no matter
Fool got no business hanging round and tellin' lies
Bicycle races are coming your way
If you can't beat 'em join them
Fun it
Oh you're gonna let it all hang out
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round

No more no more no more
Of that jazz''''''''''''''''''
