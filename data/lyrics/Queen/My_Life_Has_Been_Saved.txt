This is where we are today
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Oh Lord I thank the Lord above
My life has been saved
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Here we go
Tellin' lies
Here we go (here we go)

This is the way we are today
Oh ho oh ho

We're right back where we started from
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray - hey
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page, oh
Oh Lord I thank you father
My life has been saved

My life
My life has been saved
My life
My life
My life has been saved''''''''''''''''''
