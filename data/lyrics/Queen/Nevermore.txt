There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry and the rain stopped falling
Please don't you cry anymore
Can't you see?
Listen to the breeze, whisper to me please
Don't send me to the path of nevermore

Even the valleys below,
Where the rays of the sun were so warm and tender,
Now haven't anything to grow
Can't you see?
(Nevermore nevermore)
Why did you have to leave me?
(Nevermore nevermore)
Why did you deceive me?
You send me to the path of nevermore
When you say you didn't love me anymore
(Ah ah)
Nevermore, ah
Nevermore''''''''''''''''''
