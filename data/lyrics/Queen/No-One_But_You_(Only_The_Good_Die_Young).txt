A hand above the water
An angel reaching for the sky
Is it raining in heaven?
Do you want us to cry?

And everywhere the broken-hearted
On every lonely avenue
No one could reach them
No one but you

One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flying too close to the sun
And life goes on without you

Another tricky situation
I get to drowning in the blues
And I find myself thinking
Well, what would you do?

Yes, it was such an operation
Forever paying every due
Hell, you made a sensation
You found a way through

One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flying too close to the sun
We'll remember forever

And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leaving
Was it the way it was planned?

And so we grace another table
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never, never saying goodbye

One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flying too close to the sun
Crying for nothing, crying for no one
No one but you''''''''''''''''
