We had a good night jamming away
There was a full moon showing
And we started to play
But in the cold light of day next morning
Party was over (huh huh)
The party was over

We got love and we got style
And we got sex and I know,
I know we got what it takes
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa - whoa whoa whoa!

Why don't you come back and play
Come back and play (hey hey)
Come back and play
We got all night, all day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come back and play (hey hey)
Come back and play
Come back and play
Come back and play it
Play it, play it, play it

Go get 'em boy (Let's party!)
Yeah!
Give it, give it!

We had a food fight in somebody's face
We were up all night singing (singing)
And giving a chase
But in the cold light of day next morning
Everybody was hung over

Hey, come back and play
Come back and play
Come back and play
We got all night, all day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come back and play (and play)
Come back and play
We got all night
We got all day
We got all night and day
Come back, come back, come back, come back,
Back and play

Hey hey hey!
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, the party is over!''''''''''''''''''
