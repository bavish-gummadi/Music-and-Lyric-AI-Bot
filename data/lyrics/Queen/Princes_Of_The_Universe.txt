Here we are - born to be kings
We're the princes of the universe
Here we belong - fighting to survive
In a world with the darkest powers

And here we are -  we're the princes of the universe
Here we belong - fighting for survival
We've come to be the rulers of your world

I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings
I have no rival, no man can be my equal
Take me to the future of your world

Born to be kings, princes of the universe
Fighting and free, got your world in my hand
I'm here for your love and I'll make my stand
We were born to be princes of the universe
No man could understand, my power is in my own hand
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh 
People talk about you, people say you've had your day
I'm a man that will go far, fly to moon and reach for the stars
With my sword and head held high
Got to pass the test first time, yeah
I know that people talk about me I hear it every day
But I can prove you wrong 'cause I'm right first time
Yeah Yeah
Alright let's go, let's go
Watch this man fly
Bring on the girls

Here we are - born to be kings 
We're the princes of the universe 
Here we belong
Born to be kings, princes of the universe
Fighting and free, got your world in my hand
I'm here for your love and I'll make my stand
We were born to be princes of the
Universe...''''''''''''''''
