I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting
Acting so bizarre
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious honey
Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life a little rain must fall

No problem
Uh
Be cool now

Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
With property and finance
But you have the position
To call the shots and name the price honey
You found success and recognition
But into every life a little rain must fall

Flo Jo

You lead a fairy tale existence
But into every life a little rain must fall

Be cool
Hah
Kiss kiss

Others seem to think
You are over dramatising
Problems at work
So it's hardly surprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions honey
You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cause into every life a little rain must fall

Be cool
Get serious
All right
Play it nice and cool

Play it nice and cool
That's good
One more time
Aha
I like it''''''''''''''''''
