Ride the wild wind
Push the envelope don't sit on the fence
(Hey hey hey)
Ride the wind
Live life on the razor's edge
(Hey hey hey)
Gonna ride the whirlwind
It ain't dangerous - enough for me

Get your head down baby (yeah) we're gonna ride tonight
Your angel eyes are shining bright
I wanna take your hand - lead you from this place
Gonna leave it all behind
Check out of this rat race
Ride the wild wind (hey hey hey)
Ride the wild wind (hey hey hey)
Gonna ride the wild wind
It ain't dangerous - enough for me

Tie your hair back baby
We're gonna ride tonight (yeah)
We got freaks to the left
We got jerks to the right
Sometimes I get so low - I just have to ride
Let me take your hand
Let me be your guide

Ooh ride the wild wind
(Don't sit on the fence)
(Hey hey hey)
Ride the wild wind
(Live life on the razor's edge)
(Hey hey hey)
Gonna ride the wild wind
It ain't dangerous - enough for me

Yeah ride the wild wind (hey hey hey)
Ooh ride the wild wind (hey hey hey)
Gonna ride it ride the wild wind
It ain't dangerous - enough for me
