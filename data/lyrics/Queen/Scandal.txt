Scandal - now you've left me all the world's gonna know
Scandal - they're gonna turn our lives into a freak show
They'll see the heart ache, they'll see the love break
They'll hear me pleading, We'll say for God's sake
Over and over and over again

Scandal - now you've left me there's no healing the wounds
Hey scandal - and all the world can make us out to be fools
Here come the bad news, open the flood gates
They'll leave us bleeding, we'll say you cheapskates
Over and over and over again

So let them know when they start it's just a private affair
They'll have us hung in the air and tell me what do they care
It's only a life to be twisted and broken
They'll see the heart ache, they'll see our love break - yeah
They'll hear me pleading, I'll say for God's sake
Over and over and over and over again

Scandal scandal

Scandal
Scandal yes you're breaking my heart again
Scandal yes you're loving on out again

Today the headlines tomorrow hard times
And no one ever really knows the truth from the lies
And in the end the story deeper must hide
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside

Scandal scandal
