Words and music by Brian May

Well she's gone dear gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
Oh Lord what a fool I've been
Yes I did - too much

Didn't leave didn't leave no letter
Didn't leave no warning (you naughty thing you)
I guess I'm all to blame oh Lord
I guess I'm all to blame (see you later... right now you) -
Take it

My little dog ain't too hungry no no he just kept on barking
Viciously
Just don't seem the same oh no no
It just don't seem the same (oh see you later)

Now hit it - like that
Coming on strong

Well I got so lonely
Went and told my neighbour
She said mm mm mm mm mm
Oh Lord what a fool I've been
And she told me what to do
She said go home

Well she's gone gone this morning
See what a fool I've been oh Lord
What a fo-ooh-ooh-ool I've been'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
