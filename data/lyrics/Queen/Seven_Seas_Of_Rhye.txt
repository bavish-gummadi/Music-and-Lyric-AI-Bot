Fear me, you lords and lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls, you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye

Can you hear me, you peers and privy councilors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
The seven seas of Rhye

(Sister) I live and lie for you
(Mister) do and I'll die
You are mine, I possess you
Belong to you forever (Ever, ever, ah)

Storm the master marathon, I'll fly through
By flash and thunder fire and I'll survive
(I'll survive, I'll survive, I'll survive)
And I'll defy the laws of nature
And come out alive
(Then I'll get you)

Begone with you you shod and shady senators
Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty Titan and his troubadours
And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye

Oh I do like to be beside the seaside
Oh I do like to be beside the sea
Oh I do like to stroll along the prom prom prom
Where the brass bands play tiddley om pom pom
I do like to be beside the seaside
I do like to be beside the sea
When I'm down beside the sea I'm beside myself with glee
Beside the seaside
Beside the sea''''''''''''''''
