Well you're just 17 and all you want to do is disappear
You know what I mean there's a lot of space between your ears
The way that you touch don't feel no nothin'
Hey hey hey hey it was the D.N.A.
Hey hey hey hey that made me this way
Do you know do you know do you know just how I feel?
Do you know do you know do you know just how I feel?

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac

I feel so in-ar in-ar in-ar in-ar in-ar in-ar in-ar in-ar-tic-u-late

Gotta feelin' gotta feelin' gotta feelin' like a paralyse
It ain't no it ain't no it ain't no it ain't no surprise
Turn on the TV let it drip right down in your eyes
Hey hey hey hey it was the D.N.A.
Hey hey hey hey that made me this way
Do you know do you know do you know just how I feel?
Do you know do you know do you know just how I feel?

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac

I feel so in-ar in-ar in-ar in-ar in-ar in-ar in-ar in-ar-tic-u-late

Just how I feel
Do you know do you know do you know do you know just how I feel?

Do you know do you know do you know just how I feel?
Do you know do you know do you know do you know just how I feel?

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac''''''''''''''''''
