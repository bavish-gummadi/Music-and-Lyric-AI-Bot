Freddie: Try and put a bit of Silver Salmon, I know he doesn't know it but he might just play on, just put, just the rhythm, see if

Like silver salmon
She falls
They're all burning
Even at a (???) yeah
Deep inside they're all burning

Look out silver salmon
Look out, look out, look out the silver salmon

All along the silver skies, ah
More and in learning
All the need for silver, ah
Went away

Salmon
Look out, look out silver salmon
Ooh, yeah

Seems to me sometimes the trees
She burns leaves
Her body lies a burning
And falls into the cold sunrise

Ooh, ooh, ow
Ooh
Silver, silver salmon
Silver, silver
Riding along the silver salmon
She'll ride the burning sky, yeah''''''''''''''''
