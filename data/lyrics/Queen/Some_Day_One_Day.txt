You never heard my song before
The music was too loud
But now I think you hear me well
For now we both know how
No star can light our way
In this cloud of dark and fear
But some day, one day...

Funny how the pages turn
And hold us in between
A misty castle waits for you
And you shall be a queen
Today the cloud it hangs
Over us and all is grey
But some day, one day...

When I was you and you were me
And we were very young
Together took us nearly there
The rest may not be sung
So still the cloud it hangs
Over us and we're alone
But some day, one day...

We'll come home''''''''''''''''''
