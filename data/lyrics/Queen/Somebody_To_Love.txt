Can anybody find me somebody to love

Ooh
Each morning I get up, I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself) Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry)
Lord, what you're doing to me (yeah, yeah)
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord
Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love

Yeah
I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life
I work till I ache in my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)
I take home (goes home) my hard earned pay all on my own  (goes home on his home)
I get down (down) on my knees (knees)
And I start to pray (praise the Lord)
Till the tears run down from my eyes
(Lord) Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody
(Please) Can anybody find me somebody to love

(He works hard) Every day (every day) I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Ah, I got no common sense (he's got no common sense)
I got nobody left to believe in me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

(Oh Lord) Ooh somebody, ooh (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love
(Can anybody find me someone to love)

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing)
I'm okay, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah, yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prisoned cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord
