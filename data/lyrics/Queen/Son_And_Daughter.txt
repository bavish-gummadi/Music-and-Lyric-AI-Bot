I want you

To be a woman

Tried to be a son and daughter rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man for having your fun
Now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit
The world expects a man
To buckle down and to shovel shit
What'll you do for loving
When it's only just begun?
I want you to be a woman

Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men
An equal people preacher
Will you lead us all the same?
Well I travelled all round the world
A brand new word for day
Watching the time mustn't linger behind
Pardon me I have to get away
What'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came?
I want you to be a woman
I want you to be a woman yeah''''''''''''''''''
