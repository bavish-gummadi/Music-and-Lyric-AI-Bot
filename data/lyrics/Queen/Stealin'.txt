That's the way I am
Does everybody want to know
This is the way I lead my life - you know
Wheelin' and dealin'
And a little bit of stealin'
You know that's the way I grew up
That's the only life I know
That's the way my mother taught me
There you go

Stealin'
I gave you the key to my home
I left you alone in charge of my heart
Hey stealin'
You got me wheelin' and dealin'
You play with my feelin'
Right from the start

Can't afford to pay my rent
I had to use my common sense
To get some money I owe - oho
This guy said look in my head
Make some easy bread
Stealin' is the only way that I know

Stealin' yeah only way that I know
Yeah I like stealin' baby stealin'
I gave you both my own on my own
Left you alone
Now you'll be stealin' stealin' stealin'
All my heart
You're my baby's heart
Uh uh

Baby let 'em bleed

You're in charge of my heart
You are in charge of my heart
You are in charge
You are in charge

Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da

Yes you are in charge of my heart
I gave you the key
And turned on the bed
I gave you the key
Come on I said what have I got
What have I got

Yes
I, I got the key out of my heart
Now get that key out of my heart
I said the key, hey, of my heart
Come on''''''''''''''''
