Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
There's a rumour going 'round, gotta clear outta town
Yeah, I'm smelling like a dry fish bone
Here come the law, gonna break down the door
Gonna carry me away once more
Never, I never, I never want it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know

Woo
Ow!

Rainy afternoon I got a blowin' typhoon
And I'm playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know
Ow, hit a mark

Walking down the street shooting people that I meet
With my rubber tommy water gun
Here come the deputy, he's gonna come and get a-me
I gotta get me get up and run
They got the sirens loose
I ran right outta juice
They're gonna put me in a cell, if I can't go to Heaven
Will they let me go to Hell?

Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know
Ow!''''''''''''''''''
