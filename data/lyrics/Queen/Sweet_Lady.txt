You call me up and treat me like a dog
You call me up and tear me up inside
You've got me on a lead
Ooh you bring me down
You shout around
You don't believe that I'm alone
Oh you don't believe me

Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady... stay sweet

You say
"You call me up and feed me all the lines"
"You call me sweet like I'm some kind of cheese"
"Waiting on the shelf"
"You eat me up"
"You hold me down"
"I'm just a fool to make you a home, you really do me"

"And you say"
"Sweet lady"
"Sweet lady"
"Sweet lady... ooh, come on, stay sweet"

Stay now, my sweet lady
Though it seems like we wait forever
Stay sweet, baby
Believe and we've got everything we need

Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady... stay sweet
Stay sweet
Oh, run away
Come on
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Sweet lady
Wooh''''''''''''''''
