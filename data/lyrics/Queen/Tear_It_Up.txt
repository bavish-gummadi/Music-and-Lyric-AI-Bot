Words and music by Brian May

Are you ready? - well are you ready?
We're gonna tear it up
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

(Hey)
Give me your mind baby give me your body
Give me some time baby let's have a party
It ain't no time for sleepin' baby
Soon it's round your street I'm creeping
You'd better be ready

We gonna Tear it up
Stir it up
Break it up - baby

You gonna Tear it up
Shake it up
Make it up - as you go along

Tear it up
Square it up
Wake it up - baby

Tear it up
Stir it up
Stake it out - and you can't go wrong

(Hey listen)
I love you 'cause you're sweet and I love you 'cause you're
Naughty
I love you for your mind baby give me your body
I wanna be a toy at your birthday party
Wind me up - wind me up - wind me up - let me go

Tear it up
Stir it up
Break it up - let me go

Tear it up
Shake it up
Make it up - as you go along

Tear it up
Turn it up
Burn it up

Are you ready?(Oh yeah)
Baby baby baby are you ready for me?(Oh yeah)
Baby baby baby are you ready for love?(Oh yeah)
Are you ready - are you ready - are you ready for me?(Oh
Yeah)
I love you so near I love you so far
I gotta tell you baby you're driving me Ga Ga''''''''''''''''''
