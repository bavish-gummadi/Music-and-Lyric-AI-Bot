Here we go!

Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah

Hey I'm the hitman
Stand aside
I'm the hitman
I want your life
Ain't no escaping
Don't run and hide
There goes the neighbourhood
I'm gonna kill for your love
That's right

Hitman
Now don't you cry
I'm just it man
And you might get fried
Gun in my pocket
Don't get me wrong
I'll be your hitman
I'm a fool for your love

I'm a head shredder
That's better

Baby, baby, baby,
I'm a hitman hitman hitman

Yeah - trouble in the East troubled in the West
Struggle with the beast - what a thief, what a pest
Come back mother
Nuke that sucker
Yeah yeah yeah
Who knows what I'm talking about?

Waste that brother
All right
Ooh
That's the way to do it

I'm the hitman
I'm your prize
But this hitman can cut you down to size
Love me, baby
Don't be so cool
Love me, love me, baby
I've been to the hitman school

Yeah yeah

You're gonna make my day
Gonna blow you away

That's when the fun begins (hitman)
Are you ready for the sting
Gonna waste that thing (hitman)
Hitman is king

Go go
Oh hitman hitman''''''''''''''''''
