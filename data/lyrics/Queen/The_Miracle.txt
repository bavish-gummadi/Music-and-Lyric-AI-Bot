Every drop of rain that falls
In Sahara Desert says it all,
It's a miracle
All God's creations great and small,
The Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal,
That's a miracle
Test tube babies being born,
Mothers, fathers dead and gone,
It's a miracle

We're having a miracle on earth,
Mother nature does it all for us,
The wonders of this world go on,
The hanging Gardens of Babylon
Captain Cook and Cain and Abel,
Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle

The one thing we're all waiting for,
Is peace on earth - and an end to war
It's a miracle we need - the miracle,
The miracle we're all waiting for today

If every leaf on every tree,
Could tell a story that would be
A miracle
If every child on every street,
Had clothes to wear and food to eat,
That's a miracle
If all God's people could be free,
To live in perfect harmony,
It's a miracle

We're having a miracle on earth
Mother nature does it all for us
Open hearts and surgery (Wonders of this world go on)
Sunday mornings with a cup of tea
Super powers always fighting
But Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle

(Wonders of this world go on)

Well, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle

The one thing (the one thing)
We're all waiting for (we're all waiting for)
Is peace on earth (peace on earth)
And an end to war (an end to war)
It's a miracle we need - the miracle
The miracle
Peace on earth and end to war today

That time will come
One day you'll see
When we can all be friends

That time will come
One day you'll see
When we can all be friends

That time will come
One day you'll see
When we can all be friends

That time will come
One day you'll see
When we can all be friends''''''''''''''''''
