One dance whose steps I never could learn

It's called the wedding march

The grace that it takes, the grace you deserve,

Require a lighter touch

I know you love dancing.

Oh, I know that you love dancing so much

I know you love dancing.

Music's a wild thing with mischief to prove

I can't adjust to the way that you move

Music's a wild thing whatever the groove

Some music isn't for dancing

One dance whose steps I never could learn

It's called the wedding march

The grace that it takes, the balance and poise,

I still find a mystery

I know you love dancing.

So, I know that you'd hate dancing with me

I know you love dancing.

So, I know that you'd hate dancing with me''''''''''''''''''
